"The interplay between the microbiome, microbial metabolites, and neuropathological processes present during neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and PD. The microbiome and microbial metabolites could regulate brain homeostasis via four different ways: 1. direct absorption of specific metabolites which have the ability to cross the BBB; 2. interaction between peripheral immune systems, which interact with brain glia cells and astrocytes; 3. influence on gut hormones and the enteroendocrine system; 4. communication via the vagus nerve. These four routes may have an influence on pathological symptoms such as increased BBB leakage and neural inflammation, enhanced beta-amyloid and alpha-synuclein formation, and finally neuron loss and motor/cognitive deficits.",17293874.0,lZmWgU8-H0,QzXMSGdbwV,brain,409.0,414.0,Cellline,415.0,425.0,glia cells,Cellline,Location_of,Cellline$Cellline,"['Location_of', 'worsen', 'None', 'part_of']"
"Previous results have indicated that the metabolic regulation of BAs may be associated with T2D but the specific changes in BAs and the related mechanisms remain to be studied.

A study also suggested that patients with T2D had no change in plasma total BAs, but had an increase in DCA and a decrease in CDCA in plasma. Another study found that the plasma total BA concentration in patients with T2D was not significantly different from that of healthy people; however, the concentration of DCA in the plasma of patients with T2D was significantly higher than that of healthy controls. The mechanism may be that FXR and TGR5 are inhibited during insulin resistance, and the most effective natural ligands of the receptors, DCA and CA, are compensatorily increased. Besides, circulating BAs levels including DCA, TCA, TDCA, and glycodeoxycholic acid, are positively associated with the risk of T2D, while taurohyodeoxycholic acid is negatively associated with diabetes.

"In fact, changes in the function of gut microecology and gut microbiota may cause the occurrence and exacerbation of various diseases. It was found that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota may lead to decreased cardiac function and increased cardiomyopathy as well as cardiac insufficiency, which is of great significance in predicting CVDs and also has important predictive significance for the prognosis of adverse cardiovascular events. The gut microbiota has been reported to be associated with CVDs and its corresponding risk factors, such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, and insulin resistance. These risk factors may affect the composition and the diversity of gut microbiota. In addition, gut dysbiosis is also linked to inflammation, oxidative stress, platelet activity, thrombosis and atherosclerosis, which contribute to the progression of CVDs. The possible mechanism of gut microbiota dysbiosis related to CVDs includes its role in increasing intestinal permeability and triggering inflammation via the LPS/TLR4 as well as NLRP3 pathways, thereby ultimately contributing to the development of CVDs. In short, the inflammation directly triggers by gut microbiota is one of the possible mechanisms of CVDs susceptibility, and material metabolism affected by gut microbiota was proposed to play a role as well.",17039945.0,y-dOLK_J7L,493,gut microbiota ,1155.0,1170.0,Species,1121.0,1133.0,inflammation,Disease,causes,Species$Disease,"['Negative_correlation', 'prevents', 'experiences', 'possible', 'causes', 'Associated_with', 'decrease', 'None', 'improve', 'Marker/Mechanism', 'increase', 'affects', 'treats', 'start', 'complicates', 'Interacts_with']"

Performed analyses revealed the abundance of Proteobacteria and decreased amount of SCFAs synthesizing bacteria from Blautia, Coprococcus, and Roseburia species. It has been reported that butyrate and other SCFAs can cross the gastrointestinal endothelium and can pass through the BBB (exploiting active membrane transporters) and inhibit histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1).

"At present, it is generally believed that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota is an important factor affecting the integrity of the intestinal barrier. Previous studies showed that the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota could lead to the rapid proliferation of intestinal pathogenic bacteria, and the pro-inflammatory factors released by them seriously damaged the structure and function of the intestinal barrier, and it also promoted the occurrence and development of diseases in the digestive system as well as metabolic system. Furthermore, the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota triggers intestinal mucosal barrier damage, leading to inflammation and disordered nutrient metabolism. Overactivated inflammation caused by microbiota dysbiosis disrupts normal intestinal mucosal barrier function, and increases intestinal permeability to promote bacterial translocation, leading to endotoxemia and inflammation, thereby increasing the risk of CVDs.",16622110.0,M1BlXB46am,241,gut microbiota,559.0,573.0,Species,542.0,551.0,dysbiosis,Disease,experiences,Species$Disease,"['Negative_correlation', 'prevents', 'experiences', 'possible', 'causes', 'Associated_with', 'decrease', 'None', 'improve', 'Marker/Mechanism', 'increase', 'affects', 'treats', 'start', 'complicates', 'Interacts_with']"

"In summary, the gut microbiota generates a series of bioactive metabolites to interact with host metabolism. These metabolites mainly include SCFAs, primary and secondary BAs, TMAO, and so on. Among these metabolites, some exert synergistic effects to promote host health by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system to control glucose metabolism. For example, SCFAs interact with human hormones such as GLP-1 and PYY to effect energy uptake and the development of obesity. SCFAs are beneficial for regulating appetite and energy intake, and preventing the formation of atherosclerosis. Other metabolites, such as TMAO and phenylacetylglutamine (PAGln), may be toxic. For example, TMAO may be proatherogenic to promote the process of thrombosis and atherosclerosis, thereby increasing the risk of cardiovascular events. Patients with CVDs had lower levels of SCFA generation and higher levels of TMAO production due to the change in gut microbiota. Furthermore, TMAO causes vascular endothelial damage and promotes the production of atherosclerotic plaques. TMAO can also increase the release of intracellular calcium ions, enhance the reactivity of platelets, and increase the risk of thrombosis to increase CVDs susceptibility. Besides, PAGln enhances platelet reactivity and thrombosis, leading to CVDs. Taken together, mounting evidence suggests that changes in gut microbiota metabolites are part of the crucial mechanisms by which the gut microbiota regulates the occurrence and development of CVDs.",18055127.0,1158,1170,PAGln,1244.0,1249.0,Chemical,1306.0,1310.0,CVDs,Disease,causes,Chemical$Disease,"['improve', 'increase', 'Associated_with', 'affects', 'None', 'treats', 'Marker/Mechanism', 'causes', 'prevents', 'Negative_correlation', 'possible', 'complicates', 'decrease', 'reveals', 'worsen', 'Interacts_with']"
"Alzheimer's disease (AD), commonly known as senile dementia, is a chronic, devastating, neurodegenerative, and neuroinflammatory disorder with rising incidence and is considered to be the most frequent form of dementia in aging individuals (caused by aberrant protein processing, trafficking, and aggregation in neural cells). The World Alzheimer Report indicates that 50 million people suffer from AD-related neurological problems and this number will increase to 152 million in 2050. It is predicted that in 2030 up to 66 million people will suffer from AD. AD is a multifactorial disease characterized by synapse loss, extracellular cerebral accumulation of insoluble peptides belonging to amyloid-beta (Abeta), the aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein inside the cells, neurofibrillary mass formation, neuronal death (in the neocortex and hippocampus), progressive memory deterioration, and cognition decline leading to dementia. AD is associated with more than 700 genetic and environmental risk factors. From the genetic point of view, one of the most important risk factors related to AD development is the incidence of a ""4 allele variant in the apolipoprotein"" (APOE4) gene, which is associated with cholesterol transport in CNS, and also contributes to metabolomic and taxonomic changes in the microbiome.",16422307.0,393,388,APOE4,1181.0,1186.0,Gene,1102.0,1104.0,AD,Disease,Associated_with,Gene$Disease,"['Associated_with', 'start', 'Negative_correlation', 'increase', 'causes', 'None']"
"Multiple sclerosis is a chronic neurodegenerative autoimmune disorder, where the human immune system attacks the myelin sheath surrounding axon terminals, thereby triggering long-lasting inflammation within the CNS, abrasion formation, and demyelination of axons. Besides, afterward, it can cause autonomic and cognitive problems, motor, sensory, and visual flaws, and finally paralysis and disruption of the BBB. Various animal and human studies suggested the participation of gut microbiota in the development of MS. Animal studies on an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mice model revealed a significant reduction in Lactobacillus phyla, contributing to an impairment of the mice's immune systems. In patients diagnosed with MS, a reduction in the variety and quantity of gut bacteria was detected, confirming a moderate dysbiosis state.

The increased BCAAs-induced insulin resistance was associated with the presence of Prevotella copri and Bacteroides vulgatus. The major groups of gut bacteria that biosynthesize BCAAs are Prevotella copri and Bacteroides vulgatus, and the insulin resistance caused by elevated BCAAs levels is associated with the presence of these two bacteria.

"However host-microbiota interplay is not exclusively restricted to cell-cell interactions. Intestinal microbes are capable of producing a plethora of different types of compounds, i.e., small molecules (amino acids, neurotransmitters, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and other fatty acid derivatives, indoles, vitamins, and cofactors), polysaccharides, and proteins (i.e., bacteriocins), which have been reported as important factors in shaping the bacterial community and modulation of the immune system. It has been demonstrated that intestinal bacterial strains such as Escherichia coli or Lactobacillus spp. interact directly with the host's CNS (central nervous system), as they can release neurotransmitters such as dopamine, noradrenaline, histamine, acetylcholine, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), or serotonin. This metabolic status of the microbiome is also vulnerable to dysbiosis and compositional changes and often leads to metabolic disturbances. For example, dysbiosis can induce elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, intensifying oxidative stress and neuronal inflammatory processes.

"Similar to the AD case, the host metabolome is affected during disease, which is not without its influence on microbiome composition/metabolome. Bile acid synthesis is a common part of the metabolic system which is affected both in AD and PD. Regarding this, there were increased levels of bile acids conjugated with taurine (taurodeoxycholic, taurolithocholic, and taurochenodeoxycholic acid) observed, which correlates with motor activity in PD. It is worth underlining the role of taurine as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Moreover, it is fabricated and secreted by neurons during stress conditions, e.g., mitochondrial dysfunctions, where taurine seems to increase the neuronal survival rate due to calcium influx regulation and the intensified antioxidant gene expression. In summary, taurine demonstrates an important role in proper brain function and development. Additionally, it contributes to the volume regulation of brain cells, and interferes with synaptic amino acid receptors.",16207850.0,1064,PpRxICPwn2,PD,444.0,446.0,Chemical,344.0,360.0,taurolithocholic,Chemical,increase,Chemical$Chemical,"['affects', 'Associated_with', 'part_of', 'None', 'improve', 'Physically_related_to', 'possible', 'start', 'increase', 'decrease', 'Location_of', 'Interacts_with', 'prevents', 'worsen']"
"Aromatic amino acids including tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine are metabolized into indole and phenols by certain intestinal anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, and Peptostreptococcus. Tryptophan is decomposed into indole, indoleacetic acid, indole-3-lactic acid, 3-methylindole (skatole) and other indole compounds under the action of tryptophanase. Tryptophanase is the key enzyme that generates indole. The activity of the enzyme is easily induced by the substrate tryptophan, so when the amount of tryptophan changes in the colonic environment, the content of indole will fluctuate greatly. Of note, the metabolic products of aromatic amino acids generated by gut microbiota have a great impact on the pathology of cardiometabolic diseases. For example, indole propionic acid is associated with insulin sensitivity and appears to reduce the risk of diabetes. Moreover, the gut microbiota metabolizes dietary tryptophan to indoxyl, which further generates indoxyl sulfate through sulfonation. Excessive accumulation of indoxyl sulfate causes cardiomyocyte damage and increases thrombus formation. Another phenol compound, 4-methylphenol, can inhibit the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into mature adipocytes, induce apoptosis and reduce glucose uptake. In addition, benzoic acid is an aromatic carboxylic acid synthesized by colonic microorganisms by metabolizing dietary aromatic compounds.

"Experimental research confirms the hypothesis regarding SCFA reduction in autoimmune diseases (MS among others) and altered gut microbiota. A low level of SCFAs dysregulates Treg cell functions, leading to insufficient immune tolerance towards endogenous components and enteric microbiota. However, this process can be reversed by SCFAs supplementation (e.g., propionic acid). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing NFkappaB activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation and on microglial cells in vitro. TUDCA binds to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) expressed in microglial cells. This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS). Experimental results demonstrated that TUDCA acted as a double-edged sword, triggering microglia enhancement in anti-inflammatory and alternatively activated markers and on the other hand reducing the infiltration of macrophages and microglia with expressed pro-inflammatory markers. Interestingly, during neuroinflammation, microglial cells change their morphology, converting themselves into reactive macrophage-like forms. However, microglial cells are flexible, as they can sometimes polarize towards alternatively activated phenotypes, promoting CNS pathologies (proinflammatory or M1 microglia), or exert anti-inflammatory effects, boosting cell repair and remodeling. Bile acids were identified as nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor agonists, leading to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) depletion (in a mouse model) and neuroinflammatory process adjustment. The administration of the complex probiotic positively influenced the intestinal flora balance in patients diagnosed with MS. The probiotic prevented the onset of dysbiosis, significantly increasing the amount of Methanobrevibacter and Akkermansia, Prevotella, and Sutterella in MS patients, influencing gene expression and the production of beneficial bacterial metabolites.",16224291.0,1292,OsgHk8IQtD,patients,2764.0,2772.0,Species,2761.0,2763.0,MS,Disease,experiences,Species$Disease,"['Negative_correlation', 'prevents', 'experiences', 'possible', 'causes', 'Associated_with', 'decrease', 'None', 'improve', 'Marker/Mechanism', 'increase', 'affects', 'treats', 'start', 'complicates', 'Interacts_with']"

"Recently, bacterial strains producing SCFAs have gained extreme popularity. SCFAs are small organic monocarboxylic acids, released after the fermentation of indigestible alimentary fiber (mainly galacto- or fructooligosaccharides), plant-derived polysaccharides, or the metabolism of amino acids, and are considered a key gut-derived metabolites with beneficial health effects and as essential in gut-brain crosstalk. The type of formed SCFAs is correlated with the kind of fiber ingested and the overall gut microbiota population. For example, microbes belonging to Firmicutes phyla (e.g., Lachnospiraceae, Eubacterium, or Roseburia belonging to the Clostridia class) are responsible for the main production of butyrate, whereas Bifidobacteria spp. produce lactate and acetate. SCFAs are significantly reduced during dysbiosis, where disrupted gut epithelial integrity, inflammation, and altered microbiome metabolic processes occur. In a healthy colon, levels of SCFAs can vary depending on a diet; however, in multiple diseases, these levels are altered. SCFAs may also act in an indirect or direct way through G-protein-coupled receptors or as histone deacetylase epigenetic modulators. They participate in various physiological processes, such as cell energetics and colonocyte metabolism and skeletal, adipose, and liver tissue modulation.

"Trillions of microorganisms colonize the anaerobic and nutritious environment in the gut to form a healthy intestinal physiological ecosystem. These communities are regarded as ""gut microbiota"", and the sum total of all microorganism genomes in the gut, including their DNA sequences and other genetic information, are together called ""gut microbiomes"". Most intestinal microbial communities in the human intestinal tract are bacteria with complex structures. There are more than 1,000 species of intestinal bacteria, and the number reaches approximately 1014. The ratio of bacterial number to human cell number ranged from 10:1 to 1:1. It also contains 100-fold more genes than our own genome, which is called the second genome of the human body.

And H2S is also important in the protection of CVDs.",17124435.0,1098,GW50DDwIXI,cysteine,38.0,46.0,Chemical,0.0,29.0,Sulfur-containing amino acids,Chemical,part_of,Chemical$Chemical,"['affects', 'Associated_with', 'part_of', 'None', 'improve', 'Physically_related_to', 'possible', 'start', 'increase', 'decrease', 'Location_of', 'Interacts_with', 'prevents', 'worsen']"
"In the past decade, single dietary factors which can positively manipulate the gut microbiota-brain axis through microbiome modulation have gained significant attention. One of these factors is probiotic bacteria and/or prebiotics. Probiotics are defined as microbial organisms with a beneficial role in the host's health and homeostasis, which help to preserve digestive, metabolic, immune, and neuroendocrine functions. Naturally probiotic bacteria can be found in fermented food. Experimental results revealed that the administration of probiotics alone or in combination with prebiotics (fructooligosaccharides or galactooligosaccharides) improved the gastrointestinal barrier, which is the first line of ""defence"" from harmful factors occurring in food, and the microbiome. Probiotics and prebiotics are well-documented ""problem-solution"" for gastrointestinal diseases. Moreover, probiotics can reduce CNS inflammatory processes and activation of microglia, demonstrating promising potential for use in neurodegenerative diseases as ingestible ""psychobiotics"". Many studies indicate that the ingestion of probiotics can serve as a microbiological strategy against neurodegenerative diseases such as AD; however, the exact mechanism is under investigation. Experiments performed on mice underline the hypothesis that mechanisms related to neuroprotective effects of Bifidobacterium breve administration may be connected with neuroinflammation and cognition pathways, probably through the production of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) neurotransmitter and the regulation of the gut microbial composition. Clinical results of a randomized double-blind controlled trial revealed that 3-month exposure to Lactobacillus spp. And a Bifidobacterium bifidum ""cocktail"" enhanced cognitive functions and memory, as examined in a mini-mental state test. It was demonstrated that Bifidobacterium breve exerts positive and unique activity in AD patients, improving cognitive functions and reducing neuroinflammation. Controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trials with a 12-week multispecies probiotic treatment (comprised of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Lactobacillus fermentum) caused a significant decrease in malondialdehyde in the probiotic-treated group.",16217142.0,bj2_0RPYpN,1CgYLLCmuF,probiotics,540.0,550.0,Species,656.0,680.0,gastrointestinal barrier,Cellline,improve,Species$Cellline,"['affects', 'worsen', 'Location_of', 'Interacts_with', 'None', 'improve', 'start', 'increase', 'Associated_with', 'part_of']"
"Particularly, SCFAs also have anti-inflammatory functions. It was reported that the butyrate and propionate can inhibit the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and NF-kappaB signaling pathways. These may be because that SCFAs can inhibit the activity of HDAC, inactivate the NF-kappaB pathway and decrease the expression of interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-6, and TNF-alpha, which further control inflammation. Meanwhile, butyrate increases the acetylation of H3 histone in the Forkhead box protein P3 (FOXP3) promoter by inhibiting HDAC4, thus promoting Treg differentiation, affecting G1-phase-specific cyclins, and further resulting in the markedly inhibited proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, thereby inhibiting myocardial fibrosis and improving heart function.",17066164.0,756,769,butyrate,406.0,414.0,Chemical,517.0,522.0,HDAC4,Species,decrease,Chemical$Species,"['increase', 'None', 'Interacts_with', 'decrease', 'affects', 'part_of', 'improve', 'Associated_with', 'Physically_related_to', 'stop', 'Location_of', 'start', 'worsen']"

"Schizophrenia is a severe neuropsychological disorder affecting approximately 1% of the world's population. 16S rRNA sequencing and diversity analyses of the fecal-derived microbiota obtained from patients suffering from schizophrenia indicated lower microbiome diversity. Performed analyses revealed the abundance of Proteobacteria and decreased amount of SCFAs synthesizing bacteria from Blautia, Coprococcus, and Roseburia species. It has been reported that butyrate and other SCFAs can cross the gastrointestinal endothelium and can pass through the BBB (exploiting active membrane transporters) and inhibit histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1). Abnormal microbiota can lead to reduced levels of butyrate and can cause the elevation of HDAC1 levels in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of patients with diagnosed schizophrenia, causing altered DNA methylation, impaired synaptic plasticity and short-term memory, and the development of impaired cognitive function and social abilities.",16212573.0,MP4vfejexO,1509,BBB,554.0,557.0,Cellline,461.0,469.0,butyrate,Chemical,Location_of,Cellline$Chemical,"['Location_of', 'Interacts_with', 'affects', 'None', 'start']"
"The gut microbial community is the largest micro-ecosystem in the human body, formed by more than 1000 different species, with high density per mL and encoding approximately 4 x 106 genes, 150 times more unique than the human genome. It is predicted that the total weight of our gut microbiota deposit circulates around 1-2 kg, approximately reaching the human brain weight. Ninety-five percent of symbiotic microorganisms are located in the gut. These multi-species ecological arrangements mostly comprise anaerobic bacteria, with at least 500-1000 different species and more than 7000 strains, mainly from the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes families (accounting for approx. 90% of bacterial species). In addition, the gut microbiome is co-inhabited by bacteria belonging to Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia phyla, as well as archaea, viruses, fungi, bacteriophages, and protozoa (especially during pathologic conditions), which reside in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, maintaining symbiosis with the host.",16114793.0,h0KfcZaoLX,cKd-ghRBJv,fungi,862.0,867.0,Species,961.0,988.0,gastrointestinal (GI) tract,Cellline,Location_of,Species$Cellline,"['affects', 'worsen', 'Location_of', 'Interacts_with', 'None', 'improve', 'start', 'increase', 'Associated_with', 'part_of']"
"The PD microbiome has a diminished variety of bacterial taxonomic groups, especially the ones associated with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects and the increase of phyla, which has toxic effects. Predominantly, the reduction was observed in the Lachnospiraceae family, including Butyrivibrio, Pseudobutyrivibrio, Coprococcus, Blautia and SCFAs-producing Prevotellaceae. The increased amount of Enterobacteriaceae is linked to the severity of postural instability and walking difficulties. Moreover, the PD microbiome is characterised by increased Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium species and decreased amount of Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae. The overgrowth of Akkermansia spp. in PD patients may be strain-specific and can be related to immune-response alterations, decreased mucus thicknesses, and increased constipation. Faecalibacterium family is a crucial player producing SCFAs and anti-inflammatory metabolites, maintaining gut health. Faecalibacterium balance disturbances can lead to impaired gut-barrier function, increasing the risk of infection with enteric pathogens and boosting alpha-synuclein formation. Similarly, the Lachnospiraceae family can produce butyrate, important for the proper function of the gut epithelium. Decreased Lachnospiraceae quantity might aggravate gut inflammation, stimulate toxin production, and damage the integrity of the gut epithelial barrier. PD patients' intestinal microflora were characterised by a diminished abundance of Lachnospiraceae, which was positively correlated with PD progress, cognitive decline, and impaired motor functions. These microbiome's compositional changes correlate well with some metabolic switches. PD microbiota show reduced SCFAs production, decreased carbohydrate fermentation, and augmented proteolytic fermentation. Chen et al. demonstrated that the SCFA level was relevant to microbiota composition changes and the clinical severity of PD. The levels of SCFAs acetate, butyrate, and propionate in fecal samples of PD patients were significantly reduced, contrary to their elevated concentration in plasma. Rodent models of PD disease have shown a positive effect of SCFAs on behavior and PD symptoms. Butyrate, as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, exerts neuroprotective activity, reducing dopaminergic cell death, and motor impairment, and improving cognitive functions. Taken together, SCFAs play an important role in protection from PD disease and could be proposed as representative gut-oriented indicators for diversifying individuals with PD and placing disease progression.",16553034.0,s4rLHs96W0,XKlvE1LIeZ,Coprococcus,325.0,336.0,Species,1748.0,1773.0,carbohydrate fermentation,Chemical,None,Species$Chemical,"['None', 'Associated_with', 'start', 'affects', 'Negative_correlation', 'Interacts_with', 'possible', 'part_of', 'improve', 'decrease', 'Location_of', 'increase', 'presence', 'experiences', 'worsen']"
"It remains unclear how the gut microbiota and BAs profiles interact with each other and whether the interaction is associated with obesity. Mice fed BAs exhibited obesity and a composition change in the obesity-associated gut microbiota, which is similar to high-fat diet-fed mice. Under a high-fat diet, the concentration of intestinal BAs increases, and the composition of gut microbiota alternates. For example, the increased BAs are the main reason for the marked increase in the abundance of the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. Another study has shown that BAs and a high-fat diet promote the growth of Bilophila wadsworthia in mice, and secondary BAs produced by Bilophila spp. have been shown to induce obesity. What's more, it has been reported that the low capacity of microbiota to metabolize Tauro-beta-muricholic acid, a primary BA, might increase the risk of obesity and insulin resistance. Therefore, BAs profiles affect the composition of gut microbiota, and gut microbiota also regulates the production and ratio of different BAs to play an important role in obesity susceptibility.",18109315.0,War9aSxjLc,1612,BAs,46.0,49.0,Chemical,131.0,138.0,obesity,Disease,possible,Chemical$Disease,"['improve', 'increase', 'Associated_with', 'affects', 'None', 'treats', 'Marker/Mechanism', 'causes', 'prevents', 'Negative_correlation', 'possible', 'complicates', 'decrease', 'reveals', 'worsen', 'Interacts_with']"

Preclinical tests on genetically modified mice with PD demonstrated the correlation between Akkermansia muciniphila and Bilophila wadsworthia abundance and decreased the mice motor activity. Furthermore, Akkermansia muciniphila produces high amounts of pro-inflammatory hydrogen sulphide, correlated with PD pathology and being a neurotoxin affecting brain mitochondrial energy homeostasis through the inhibition of brain glutathione concentration.

"Experimental research confirms the hypothesis regarding SCFA reduction in autoimmune diseases (MS among others) and altered gut microbiota. A low level of SCFAs dysregulates Treg cell functions, leading to insufficient immune tolerance towards endogenous components and enteric microbiota. However, this process can be reversed by SCFAs supplementation (e.g., propionic acid). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing NFkappaB activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation and on microglial cells in vitro. TUDCA binds to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) expressed in microglial cells. This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS). Experimental results demonstrated that TUDCA acted as a double-edged sword, triggering microglia enhancement in anti-inflammatory and alternatively activated markers and on the other hand reducing the infiltration of macrophages and microglia with expressed pro-inflammatory markers. Interestingly, during neuroinflammation, microglial cells change their morphology, converting themselves into reactive macrophage-like forms. However, microglial cells are flexible, as they can sometimes polarize towards alternatively activated phenotypes, promoting CNS pathologies (proinflammatory or M1 microglia), or exert anti-inflammatory effects, boosting cell repair and remodeling. Bile acids were identified as nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor agonists, leading to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) depletion (in a mouse model) and neuroinflammatory process adjustment. The administration of the complex probiotic positively influenced the intestinal flora balance in patients diagnosed with MS. The probiotic prevented the onset of dysbiosis, significantly increasing the amount of Methanobrevibacter and Akkermansia, Prevotella, and Sutterella in MS patients, influencing gene expression and the production of beneficial bacterial metabolites.",16224291.0,1299,1293,GPBAR1,1088.0,1094.0,Species,1095.0,1099.0,TGR5,Species,Interacts_with,Species$Species,"['None', 'part_of', 'increase', 'experiences', 'affects', 'Associated_with', 'start', 'improve', 'Location_of', 'presence', 'possible', 'decrease', 'worsen', 'Interacts_with', 'treats']"

"Insufficient dietary fiber intake is considered to be an important risk factor for diabetes. The decrease in the production of SCFAs counts for an important reason here. Modulation of dietary SCFAs is thought to reshape the gut microbiota in diabetes and ameliorate diabetes. SCFAs increase fatty acid oxidation and energy expenditure to decrease the risk of suffering from T2D. Of note, T2D patients have lower levels of butyrate-generating bacteria. Butyrate could promote the secretion of postprandial insulin; and the increase in fecal propionic acid was associated with an increase in T2D risk. In oral glucose tolerance test, a high butyrate-producing microbiota was associated with an improved insulin response (indicating improved beta-cell function), and butyrate concentration was directly related to postprandial insulin sensitivity.

"The bacteria living in the human gut are also called commensals. Some beneficial commensal microbes could repair the normal function of the intestinal barrier and exert anti-inflammatory effects, such as Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila), Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Roseburia intestinalis, et al. .

"Previous results have indicated that the metabolic regulation of BAs may be associated with T2D but the specific changes in BAs and the related mechanisms remain to be studied. It is also unclear how the different types of BAs change in patients with T2D. A study also suggested that patients with T2D had no change in plasma total BAs, but had an increase in DCA and a decrease in CDCA in plasma. Another study found that the plasma total BA concentration in patients with T2D was not significantly different from that of healthy people; however, the concentration of DCA in the plasma of patients with T2D was significantly higher than that of healthy controls. The mechanism may be that FXR and TGR5 are inhibited during insulin resistance, and the most effective natural ligands of the receptors, DCA and CA, are compensatorily increased. Besides, circulating BAs levels including DCA, TCA, TDCA, and glycodeoxycholic acid, are positively associated with the risk of T2D, while taurohyodeoxycholic acid is negatively associated with diabetes.

"In addition, phosphatidylcholine can be hydrolyzed into choline in the intestine in vivo, and the gut microbiota can convert choline into trimethylamine (TMA). After being absorbed by the intestinal tract, TMA is further transported to the liver and oxidized into TMAO by liver flavin monooxygenase 3 (FMO3), which plays an important role in human health and CVDs. TMAO also reduces reverse cholesterol transportation, and changes BAs composition. Some studies genetically manipulated hepatic FMO3 to modulate lipid homeostasis, suggesting a major role of gut microbiota in lipid metabolism.

"Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most widespread neurodegenerative diseases, second place in incidence among them, concerning around 1% of the population over the age of 60, reducing the quality of life and leading to progressive disability. The death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta is characteristic of PD. This disease causes symptoms such as rest tremors, bradykinesia, muscular rigidity, and postural stability problems. Parkinson's disease is characterized not only by neurological disorders, but also by gastrointestinal disturbances, including nausea, constipation (affecting more than 70% of PD patients), vomiting, reduced colonic motility, and gut microbiota changes (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth among many others).

"Insufficient dietary fiber intake is considered to be an important risk factor for diabetes. The decrease in the production of SCFAs counts for an important reason here. Modulation of dietary SCFAs is thought to reshape the gut microbiota in diabetes and ameliorate diabetes. SCFAs increase fatty acid oxidation and energy expenditure to decrease the risk of suffering from T2D. Of note, T2D patients have lower levels of butyrate-generating bacteria. Butyrate could promote the secretion of postprandial insulin; and the increase in fecal propionic acid was associated with an increase in T2D risk. In oral glucose tolerance test, a high butyrate-producing microbiota was associated with an improved insulin response (indicating improved beta-cell function), and butyrate concentration was directly related to postprandial insulin sensitivity. Besides, in signal transduction regulation, butyrate could also inhibit HDAC expression in juvenile diabetic rats to modulate the p38/ERK/MAPK signaling pathway, which ultimately prevents beta-cell apoptosis and improves glucose homeostasis.",18120409.0,1886,qJKiYkT54R,butyrate,889.0,897.0,Chemical,917.0,921.0,HDAC,Species,decrease,Chemical$Species,"['increase', 'None', 'Interacts_with', 'decrease', 'affects', 'part_of', 'improve', 'Associated_with', 'Physically_related_to', 'stop', 'Location_of', 'start', 'worsen']"

"At present, it is generally believed that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota is an important factor affecting the integrity of the intestinal barrier. Previous studies showed that the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota could lead to the rapid proliferation of intestinal pathogenic bacteria, and the pro-inflammatory factors released by them seriously damaged the structure and function of the intestinal barrier, and it also promoted the occurrence and development of diseases in the digestive system as well as metabolic system. Furthermore, the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota triggers intestinal mucosal barrier damage, leading to inflammation and disordered nutrient metabolism. Overactivated inflammation caused by microbiota dysbiosis disrupts normal intestinal mucosal barrier function, and increases intestinal permeability to promote bacterial translocation, leading to endotoxemia and inflammation, thereby increasing the risk of CVDs.",16622110.0,SRvmW0PyAa,245,intestinal permeability,803.0,826.0,Disease,874.0,885.0,endotoxemia,Disease,causes,Disease$Disease,"['None', 'possible', 'part_of', 'causes', 'Associated_with', 'Marker/Mechanism', 'affects', 'reveals', 'increase', 'worsen', 'presence', 'complicates']"
"Recently, bacterial strains producing SCFAs have gained extreme popularity. SCFAs are small organic monocarboxylic acids, released after the fermentation of indigestible alimentary fiber (mainly galacto- or fructooligosaccharides), plant-derived polysaccharides, or the metabolism of amino acids, and are considered a key gut-derived metabolites with beneficial health effects and as essential in gut-brain crosstalk. The type of formed SCFAs is correlated with the kind of fiber ingested and the overall gut microbiota population. For example, microbes belonging to Firmicutes phyla (e.g., Lachnospiraceae, Eubacterium, or Roseburia belonging to the Clostridia class) are responsible for the main production of butyrate, whereas Bifidobacteria spp. produce lactate and acetate. SCFAs are significantly reduced during dysbiosis, where disrupted gut epithelial integrity, inflammation, and altered microbiome metabolic processes occur. In a healthy colon, levels of SCFAs can vary depending on a diet; however, in multiple diseases, these levels are altered. SCFAs may also act in an indirect or direct way through G-protein-coupled receptors or as histone deacetylase epigenetic modulators.

"The health of the gut microbiome can vary depending on various factors including diet (e.g., ingestion of saturated/unsaturated dietary fats, vitamins, minerals, dairy products, alcoholic beverages, polyphenols containing food such as cocoa-rich chocolate, tea, or coffee), dietary patterns, geographical area, and diet-related habits (sometimes varying between males and females) and sex (the influence of sex hormones). A positive correlation between polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (N-3 PUFA), and alpha-linolenic acid (aLNA) ingestion and protection against PD development in dose-response trends was demonstrated. American studies demonstrated that PUFA replacement with increased animal fat intake (Western Diet) significantly increased the risk of PD in males only. Excessive animal fat intake can promote dysbiosis and the production of harmful microbial metabolites, which can increase the prevalence of the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, sex differences are implicated in the mental health and prevalence of psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, and neurodegenerative disorders. It has been demonstrated that PD patients usually have altered microbiome compositions compared with controls. Similar to AD, many sex differences in PD are correlated with the protective nature of estrogens, as they are impacted by the gut-brain axis and protect against oxidative damage, thereby supporting dopaminergic function. It has been demonstrated that at age 45, the estimated overall lifetime risk for AD is about 20% for females and 10% for males, which is followed by a disruption in the patient's gut microbiota composition.

SCFAs are small organic monocarboxylic acids, released after the fermentation of indigestible alimentary fiber (mainly galacto- or fructooligosaccharides), plant-derived polysaccharides, or the metabolism of amino acids, and are considered a key gut-derived metabolites with beneficial health effects and as essential in gut-brain crosstalk. The type of formed SCFAs is correlated with the kind of fiber ingested and the overall gut microbiota population. For example, microbes belonging to Firmicutes phyla (e.g., Lachnospiraceae, Eubacterium, or Roseburia belonging to the Clostridia class) are responsible for the main production of butyrate, whereas Bifidobacteria spp. produce lactate and acetate. SCFAs are significantly reduced during dysbiosis, where disrupted gut epithelial integrity, inflammation, and altered microbiome metabolic processes occur. In a healthy colon, levels of SCFAs can vary depending on a diet; however, in multiple diseases, these levels are altered. SCFAs may also act in an indirect or direct way through G-protein-coupled receptors or as histone deacetylase epigenetic modulators. They participate in various physiological processes, such as cell energetics and colonocyte metabolism and skeletal, adipose, and liver tissue modulation. Their major functions comprise the activation of trophic factors, energy management, and the manufacturing of regulatory T-cells. Short-chain fatty acids can be considered as key intermediaries in numerous neurological diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, stroke, and neuropsychiatric conditions.",16409429.0,YQnO-FmwWh,-5xvGmF7k8,SCFAs,1058.0,1063.0,Chemical,1321.0,1333.0,liver tissue,Cellline,Associated_with,Chemical$Cellline,"['improve', 'Interacts_with', 'None', 'Associated_with', 'decrease', 'worsen', 'Location_of', 'increase', 'affects', 'start', 'Physically_related_to', 'causes']"
"Trillions of microorganisms colonize the anaerobic and nutritious environment in the gut to form a healthy intestinal physiological ecosystem. These communities are regarded as ""gut microbiota"", and the sum total of all microorganism genomes in the gut, including their DNA sequences and other genetic information, are together called ""gut microbiomes"". Most intestinal microbial communities in the human intestinal tract are bacteria with complex structures. There are more than 1,000 species of intestinal bacteria, and the number reaches approximately 1014. The ratio of bacterial number to human cell number ranged from 10:1 to 1:1. It also contains 100-fold more genes than our own genome, which is called the second genome of the human body. In terms of the types of intestinal bacteria, the gut microbiota is mainly composed of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, and this composition is relatively stable in healthy individuals but not in patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) or other diseases. Among those gut microbiota, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in the large intestine account for about 90% of the total number of gut microbiota, and the ratio is a vital health indicator reflecting the condition of health and is also associated with the incidence of CVDs. In addition, the gut microbiota maintains a symbiotic or antagonistic relationship with its host to form a dynamic and balanced microbial system.",16511252.0,51,46,patients,973.0,981.0,Species,1012.0,1016.0,CVDs,Disease,experiences,Species$Disease,"['Negative_correlation', 'prevents', 'experiences', 'possible', 'causes', 'Associated_with', 'decrease', 'None', 'improve', 'Marker/Mechanism', 'increase', 'affects', 'treats', 'start', 'complicates', 'Interacts_with']"
"The gut microbiota can affect the occurrence of diabetes by affecting the composition and metabolism of BAs, as well as their binding to FXR and TGR5 receptors. An excess of secondary BAs produced by dysregulated gut microbiota can stimulate intestinal parietal cells to secrete a large amount of serotonin, thereby increasing blood glucose levels. In patients with diabetes, changes in gut microbiota composition may alter the ratio of primary BAs to secondary BAs. However, from the impaired fasting glucose level to impaired glucose tolerance, and finally to T2D, the specific changes in gut microbiota and BAs pools at different stages of this process have not been fully studied.",18121584.0,RhIQ2WmFpt,N1DWjJAgJy,gut microbiota,213.0,227.0,Species,174.0,187.0,secondary BAs,Chemical,start,Species$Chemical,"['None', 'Associated_with', 'start', 'affects', 'Negative_correlation', 'Interacts_with', 'possible', 'part_of', 'improve', 'decrease', 'Location_of', 'increase', 'presence', 'experiences', 'worsen']"

"It is currently controversial whether supplementation with BCAAs would increase circulating BCAAs, thereby increasing the risk of diabetes. And reducing BCAAs intake promotes fat mass loss and insulin sensitivity in mice with obesity. A high BCAAs diet causes excessive feeding, mainly due to excessive appetite. Adding threonine to balance the composition of amino acids in the diet can inhibit food intake. Nevertheless, some studies have found that supplementary BCAAs, such as isoleucine and leucine, can improve insulin resistance and reduce weight to lower the risk of obesity and diabetes. The inconsistency may be due to the individual state of energy excess or energy deficiency. In terms of an excessive energy state, such as in patients with obesity or diabetes who have an impaired ability to degrade BCAAs, BCAAs and related metabolites accumulate in circulation to reduce insulin sensitivity and cause insulin resistance. In most elderly people with inadequate energy or athletes who maintain good fitness habits, BCAAs can improve the form of metabolism. In these people, BCAAs decomposition metabolism is increased by regulatory factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha coactivator (PGC-1alpha) and PPARalpha, so that BCAAs levels are maintained in a steady state, which ultimately promotes glucose intake and insulin sensitivity. This was supported by the study of Newgard, who pointed out that dietary intake of BCAAs might interact with a high-fat diet to induce abnormal metabolic phenotypes such as insulin resistance. Mice fed BCAAs alone did not develop insulin resistance. However, when mice were fed a high-fat diet supplemented with BCAAs, they developed insulin resistance. This study suggested that BCAAs only lead to insulin resistance in the presence of excess energy intake. Therefore, more studies are needed to explore the supplementation with BCAAs and insulin resistance as well as the development of cardiovascular risk factors.",19341206.0,2452,2466,leucine,496.0,503.0,Chemical,575.0,582.0,obesity,Disease,prevents,Chemical$Disease,"['improve', 'increase', 'Associated_with', 'affects', 'None', 'treats', 'Marker/Mechanism', 'causes', 'prevents', 'Negative_correlation', 'possible', 'complicates', 'decrease', 'reveals', 'worsen', 'Interacts_with']"
"The bacteria living in the human gut are also called commensals. Some beneficial commensal microbes could repair the normal function of the intestinal barrier and exert anti-inflammatory effects, such as Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila), Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Roseburia intestinalis, et al. . These commensal microbes make up about 20% of the total gut microbiota. They are indispensable for maintaining the physiological function of adult tissues and organs by synthesizing a variety of vitamins, participating in food digestion, producing lactic acid, promoting intestinal peristalsis, inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microbiota, and activating the immune system. For example, one of the most important commensal microbes in the human gut is Bifidobacterium, a strictly anaerobic gram-positive bacterium, which assists the human body in the digestion and absorption of nutrients, resists the invasion of harmful bacteria, improves the immune function of the body, secretes molecules to regulate immune function, and participates in the metabolism of substances in the intestine. Besides, another common commensal microbe, A. muciniphila, a gram-positive bacterium, reduces insulin sensitivity and is inversely associated with the development of obesity and diabetes.

TMAO is produced from dietary phosphatidylcholine by the intestinal microbiota. Preclinical models of cerebral ischemia indicate the coexistence of pathological microflora which negatively affect intestinal permeability and motility. Some reported experimental results indicate the relationship of intestinal microbiota with neuroinflammatory processes by modulating intestinal T-cell trafficking to the CNS.

"Recent studies underlined the important role of the gut microbiota in bidirectional crosstalk in Huntington's disease (HD). Huntington's disease has genetic origins related to trinucleotide expansion (CAG) in the huntingtin coding gene. Moreover, experiments performed in mice models revealed that the altered microbiota observed in the HD-suffering individuals at the pre-motor symptomatic stage highly influence health status. HD microbiota composition indicated dysbiosis, disturbances in cytokine levels, and an increase in sulphur metabolism characterized by hydrogen sulphide overproduction and negatively influencing gut health. Ultimately, the gut dysbiosis state was also described in a transgenic mice model representing Huntington's disease. Kong et al. found increased Bacteroidetes and decreased Firmicutes levels in a R6/1 transgenic mice model. In this study, dysbiosis was followed by body weight deterioration, gastrointestinal motility problems, and the loss of motor ability. Subsequent studies performed by the same group revealed the negative correlation between Blautia producta and butyrate production. Moreover, Prevotella scopos was negatively associated with ATP levels.

"At the end of this chapter, it is worth mentioning the fact that the interaction between the microbiome and the host is bidirectional, and some metabolic changes, which could be a pathological result of disease progression, also influence microbiome metabolism. A good example is a disturbance in cholesterol homeostasis, which correlates with an augmented probability of Alzheimer's disease occurrence. In addition, alteration of the intestinal microbiota composition with the subsequent fluctuations in the serum and brain levels of bile acids (BAs) is involved in the development of AD. BAs can act as detergents, affecting BBB permeability, and incrementing brain influx of peripheral cholesterol and BAs. Therefore, proper cholesterol elimination pathways play a crucial role in AD prevention and treatment. The gut microbiome is a main ""organ"" metabolizing secondary bile acids. Peripheral cholesterol is eliminated mainly through its liver conversion to BAs. The gut microbiota performs BA transformation via deconjugation and dehydroxylation, leading to secondary BA formation. Nho et al. investigated the correlation between neurodegeneration and BAs, B-amyloid, and tau protein concentration. The application of targeted metabolomics enabled the determination of the association between intestinal microbiota-derived secondary bile acids and sera BAs. Interestingly, the analysis indicated an imbalanced BA ratio, underlying an increased amount of secondary BAs over primary ones. Another clinical study confirmed the correlation between bile acid metabolic profile and the prevalence of AD and mild cognitive impairment, showing similar BA ratio disruptions. Decreased cognitive functions were positively associated with increased concentrations of secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid, and glycolithocholic acid.

"In the past decade, single dietary factors which can positively manipulate the gut microbiota-brain axis through microbiome modulation have gained significant attention. One of these factors is probiotic bacteria and/or prebiotics. Probiotics are defined as microbial organisms with a beneficial role in the host's health and homeostasis, which help to preserve digestive, metabolic, immune, and neuroendocrine functions. Naturally probiotic bacteria can be found in fermented food. Experimental results revealed that the administration of probiotics alone or in combination with prebiotics (fructooligosaccharides or galactooligosaccharides) improved the gastrointestinal barrier, which is the first line of ""defence"" from harmful factors occurring in food, and the microbiome. Probiotics and prebiotics are well-documented ""problem-solution"" for gastrointestinal diseases. Moreover, probiotics can reduce CNS inflammatory processes and activation of microglia, demonstrating promising potential for use in neurodegenerative diseases as ingestible ""psychobiotics"". Many studies indicate that the ingestion of probiotics can serve as a microbiological strategy against neurodegenerative diseases such as AD; however, the exact mechanism is under investigation. Experiments performed on mice underline the hypothesis that mechanisms related to neuroprotective effects of Bifidobacterium breve administration may be connected with neuroinflammation and cognition pathways, probably through the production of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) neurotransmitter and the regulation of the gut microbial composition.

"Aromatic amino acids including tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine are metabolized into indole and phenols by certain intestinal anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, and Peptostreptococcus. Tryptophan is decomposed into indole, indoleacetic acid, indole-3-lactic acid, 3-methylindole (skatole) and other indole compounds under the action of tryptophanase. Tryptophanase is the key enzyme that generates indole. The activity of the enzyme is easily induced by the substrate tryptophan, so when the amount of tryptophan changes in the colonic environment, the content of indole will fluctuate greatly. Of note, the metabolic products of aromatic amino acids generated by gut microbiota have a great impact on the pathology of cardiometabolic diseases. For example, indole propionic acid is associated with insulin sensitivity and appears to reduce the risk of diabetes. Moreover, the gut microbiota metabolizes dietary tryptophan to indoxyl, which further generates indoxyl sulfate through sulfonation. Excessive accumulation of indoxyl sulfate causes cardiomyocyte damage and increases thrombus formation. Another phenol compound, 4-methylphenol, can inhibit the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into mature adipocytes, induce apoptosis and reduce glucose uptake. In addition, benzoic acid is an aromatic carboxylic acid synthesized by colonic microorganisms by metabolizing dietary aromatic compounds.

"Alzheimer's disease (AD), commonly known as senile dementia, is a chronic, devastating, neurodegenerative, and neuroinflammatory disorder with rising incidence and is considered to be the most frequent form of dementia in aging individuals (caused by aberrant protein processing, trafficking, and aggregation in neural cells). The World Alzheimer Report indicates that 50 million people suffer from AD-related neurological problems and this number will increase to 152 million in 2050. It is predicted that in 2030 up to 66 million people will suffer from AD. AD is a multifactorial disease characterized by synapse loss, extracellular cerebral accumulation of insoluble peptides belonging to amyloid-beta (Abeta), the aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein inside the cells, neurofibrillary mass formation, neuronal death (in the neocortex and hippocampus), progressive memory deterioration, and cognition decline leading to dementia. AD is associated with more than 700 genetic and environmental risk factors. From the genetic point of view, one of the most important risk factors related to AD development is the incidence of a ""4 allele variant in the apolipoprotein"" (APOE4) gene, which is associated with cholesterol transport in CNS, and also contributes to metabolomic and taxonomic changes in the microbiome.",16422307.0,JQGUVVRpe_,382,insoluble peptides,661.0,679.0,Species,560.0,562.0,AD,Disease,Marker/Mechanism,Species$Disease,"['Negative_correlation', 'prevents', 'experiences', 'possible', 'causes', 'Associated_with', 'decrease', 'None', 'improve', 'Marker/Mechanism', 'increase', 'affects', 'treats', 'start', 'complicates', 'Interacts_with']"
"In addition, phosphatidylcholine can be hydrolyzed into choline in the intestine in vivo, and the gut microbiota can convert choline into trimethylamine (TMA). After being absorbed by the intestinal tract, TMA is further transported to the liver and oxidized into TMAO by liver flavin monooxygenase 3 (FMO3), which plays an important role in human health and CVDs. TMAO also reduces reverse cholesterol transportation, and changes BAs composition. Some studies genetically manipulated hepatic FMO3 to modulate lipid homeostasis, suggesting a major role of gut microbiota in lipid metabolism. Furthermore, changes in TMAO levels have been found in metabolic diseases such as fatty liver and hyperlipidemia, suggesting that lipid metabolism mediated by gut microbiota plays an important role in the occurrence and development of diseases.",17118299.0,920,917,metabolic diseases,647.0,665.0,Disease,616.0,620.0,TMAO,Chemical,affects,Disease$Chemical,"['decrease', 'affects', 'increase', 'start', 'None', 'Associated_with', 'Location_of', 'possible', 'stop']"
"BAs, as by-products of cholesterol metabolism, are the main organic component of bile and are synthesized in hepatocytes. Cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) are primary BAs directly synthesized from cholesterol; secondary BAs include deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholic acid (LCA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and their glycine and taurine conjugated forms. BAs are excreted into the intestine to aid in the digestion and absorption of lipids and combine with farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and takeda-G-protein receptor 5 (TGR5) (Fig. 2). There is a strong biochemical relationship between BAs and gut microbiota. Some gut microbiota in healthy people can convert conjugated BAs into free BAs, and can transform BAs into secondary BAs with the help of bile salt hydrolase (BSH) and cholesterol 7-alpha hydroxy-lase (CYP7A1), so as to reduce blood cholesterol by affecting the enterohepatic circulation of BAs. Besides, the gut microbiota affects the metabolism of BAs by regulating the activity of BSH to reduce LDL cholesterol levels. BAs have bacteriostatic properties and an antimicrobial effect. BAs destroy the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane and thereby change the intestinal microecology. BAs also prevent bacteria from overgrowth and decrease inflammation. More importantly, BAs are also closely associated with CVDs. For example, BAs levels in the feces of patients with CVDs are different from those in healthy individuals. And BAs have been reported to regulate vascular tension and affect ion exchange on cardiomyocyte membranes, suggesting that regulating BAs by gut microbiota might be a treatment for CVDs.",17301489.0,c14s8LjamL,KAUXKWaQLF,bile salt hydrolase,764.0,783.0,Chemical,724.0,727.0,BAs,Chemical,affects,Chemical$Chemical,"['affects', 'Associated_with', 'part_of', 'None', 'improve', 'Physically_related_to', 'possible', 'start', 'increase', 'decrease', 'Location_of', 'Interacts_with', 'prevents', 'worsen']"

Several studies have also demonstrated that many traditional and latest therapeutic treatments of CVDs are associated with the gut microbiota and its generated metabolites and related signaling pathways. Given that information, we summarized the latest advances in the current research regarding the effect of gut microbiota on health, the main cardiovascular risk factors, and CVDs, highlighted the roles and mechanisms of several metabolites, and introduced corresponding promising treatments for CVDs regarding the gut microbiota. Therefore, this review mainly focuses on exploring the role of gut microbiota related metabolites and their therapeutic potential in CVDs, which may eventually provide better solutions in the development of therapeutic treatment as well as the prevention of CVDs.",16509972.0,jzud5fYa8B,25,metabolites,1215.0,1226.0,Chemical,1282.0,1286.0,CVDs,Disease,possible,Chemical$Disease,"['improve', 'increase', 'Associated_with', 'affects', 'None', 'treats', 'Marker/Mechanism', 'causes', 'prevents', 'Negative_correlation', 'possible', 'complicates', 'decrease', 'reveals', 'worsen', 'Interacts_with']"
"Additionally, other commensal bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Helicobacter pylori, segmented filamentous Bacteria, and enterotoxigenic B. fragilis are called pathobionts. They make up about 70% of the total gut microbiota and interact with the host to regulate the immune response. They are harmless under physical conditions, and have a potential pathogenic influence on the host following changes in the environment. However, in the case of immune dysfunction and other pathological conditions, these pathobionts can greatly proliferate in a short time period, or translocate from the intestine to other parts of the body to be pathogenic.",16619372.0,_pPwBPYyfS,kcujwUyCKV,enterotoxigenic B. fragilis,152.0,179.0,Species,639.0,656.0,parts of the body,Cellline,worsen,Species$Cellline,"['affects', 'worsen', 'Location_of', 'Interacts_with', 'None', 'improve', 'start', 'increase', 'Associated_with', 'part_of']"
"BAs, as by-products of cholesterol metabolism, are the main organic component of bile and are synthesized in hepatocytes. Cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) are primary BAs directly synthesized from cholesterol; secondary BAs include deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholic acid (LCA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and their glycine and taurine conjugated forms. BAs are excreted into the intestine to aid in the digestion and absorption of lipids and combine with farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and takeda-G-protein receptor 5 (TGR5) (Fig. 2). There is a strong biochemical relationship between BAs and gut microbiota. Some gut microbiota in healthy people can convert conjugated BAs into free BAs, and can transform BAs into secondary BAs with the help of bile salt hydrolase (BSH) and cholesterol 7-alpha hydroxy-lase (CYP7A1), so as to reduce blood cholesterol by affecting the enterohepatic circulation of BAs. Besides, the gut microbiota affects the metabolism of BAs by regulating the activity of BSH to reduce LDL cholesterol levels. BAs have bacteriostatic properties and an antimicrobial effect. BAs destroy the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane and thereby change the intestinal microecology. BAs also prevent bacteria from overgrowth and decrease inflammation. More importantly, BAs are also closely associated with CVDs. For example, BAs levels in the feces of patients with CVDs are different from those in healthy individuals. And BAs have been reported to regulate vascular tension and affect ion exchange on cardiomyocyte membranes, suggesting that regulating BAs by gut microbiota might be a treatment for CVDs.",17301489.0,WfP-qnxsYC,880,BAs,373.0,376.0,Chemical,497.0,500.0,FXR,Species,Interacts_with,Chemical$Species,"['increase', 'None', 'Interacts_with', 'decrease', 'affects', 'part_of', 'improve', 'Associated_with', 'Physically_related_to', 'stop', 'Location_of', 'start', 'worsen']"
"Sulfur-containing amino acids such as cysteine and methionine produce sulfides under the action of intestinal bacteria, which are mainly produced by the desulfurization reaction of intestinal bacteria. Studies have found that bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Clostridium and Enterobacter aerogenes in the large intestine can lyse sulfur-containing amino acids.

And some intestinal bacteria from other genera have been reported to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, which may increase the development of insulin resistance. In short, the dysbiosis of gut microbiota would lead to the damaged function of beta-cell and islet chronic inflammatory response by changing the component of SCFAs, BCAAs, and BAs, thereby affecting glucose and fat metabolism, eventually leading to the occurrence of diabetes.",18119457.0,1841,1838,Faecalibacterium prausnitzii,174.0,202.0,Species,294.0,306.0,inflammation,Disease,decrease,Species$Disease,"['Negative_correlation', 'prevents', 'experiences', 'possible', 'causes', 'Associated_with', 'decrease', 'None', 'improve', 'Marker/Mechanism', 'increase', 'affects', 'treats', 'start', 'complicates', 'Interacts_with']"

"Besides the propagation of an inflammatory state, microbial endotoxins are probably involved in AD's inflammatory amyloidosis. Metagenomics analysis showed that patients suffering from cognitive dysfunctions related to amyloidosis demonstrated elevated amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neurotoxic compounds. In these patients, increased inflammation was probably related to Eubacterium deficiency, and an overabundance of gram-negative Escherichia and Shigella species, which are known amyloid producers. They manufacture ""curli"" amyloid fibers, accumulated extracellularly through an elaborated system. Further studies revealed that the overproduction of Abeta plaques is correlated with excessive growth of Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycobacterium and Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus spp.. Galloway et al. found Abeta in small intestine epithelial cells, suggesting that gut-derived amyloids could be absorbed and finally reach systemic circulation, where they can act as pro-inflammatory factors and trigger fibrillogenesis. Additionally, it was shown that amyloids generated by microbes can influence IL-17A and IL-22 proinflammatory cytokines production, considered as a key players in NFkappaB signaling, both associated with AD and capable of crossing the BBB and GI tract.",16171393.0,711,tGDATwlZsy,Abeta,665.0,670.0,Species,796.0,806.0,Salmonella,Species,increase,Species$Species,"['None', 'part_of', 'increase', 'experiences', 'affects', 'Associated_with', 'start', 'improve', 'Location_of', 'presence', 'possible', 'decrease', 'worsen', 'Interacts_with', 'treats']"

For example, patients with T2D have reduced Clostridium butyricum in the gut, a main butyrate-producing bacteria. Lower concentrations of butyrate producing microbiota have been observed in fecal samples of patients with T2D. Moreover, Lactobacillus is positively correlated with fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels, while Clostridium is negatively correlated with fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels.

"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal health condition caused by the progressive neural death of the spinal cord, brain stem, and motor cortex neurons, causing advanced weakness, paralysis, eating difficulties, and respiratory failure. One of the main signs of ALS is the accumulation of phosphorylated protein, which binds to DNA in the form of protein aggregates deposited in glia and motor neurons. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) methods, such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing, have demonstrated the alteration of numerous bacteria, including Parabacteroides distasonis, Lactobacillus gasseri, Prevotella melaninogenica, Ruminococcus torques, and Akkermansia muciniphila. Changes in bacterial abundance and diversity correlate with ASL origins (as one of the environmental factors) together with impaired metabolism, immunological functions, and toxin accumulation, leading to brain damage. It has been demonstrated that Akkermansia muciniphila alleviates ALS symptoms, although Ruminococcus torques and Parabacteroides distasonis aggravate them. The main switches have been observed in SCFA-producing bacteria, leading to reduced levels of SCFAs, e.g., butyrate and propionate.",16209248.0,vJNGfMveut,1352,ALS,270.0,273.0,Disease,603.0,628.0,Prevotella melaninogenica,Species,worsen,Disease$Species,"['affects', 'None', 'decrease', 'increase', 'Associated_with', 'Negative_correlation', 'worsen', 'possible', 'presence', 'causes', 'part_of']"
"Insufficient dietary fiber intake is considered to be an important risk factor for diabetes. The decrease in the production of SCFAs counts for an important reason here. Modulation of dietary SCFAs is thought to reshape the gut microbiota in diabetes and ameliorate diabetes. SCFAs increase fatty acid oxidation and energy expenditure to decrease the risk of suffering from T2D. Of note, T2D patients have lower levels of butyrate-generating bacteria. Butyrate could promote the secretion of postprandial insulin; and the increase in fecal propionic acid was associated with an increase in T2D risk. In oral glucose tolerance test, a high butyrate-producing microbiota was associated with an improved insulin response (indicating improved beta-cell function), and butyrate concentration was directly related to postprandial insulin sensitivity. Besides, in signal transduction regulation, butyrate could also inhibit HDAC expression in juvenile diabetic rats to modulate the p38/ERK/MAPK signaling pathway, which ultimately prevents beta-cell apoptosis and improves glucose homeostasis.",18120409.0,1886,1891,butyrate,889.0,897.0,Chemical,1066.0,1085.0,glucose homeostasis,Disease,improve,Chemical$Disease,"['improve', 'increase', 'Associated_with', 'affects', 'None', 'treats', 'Marker/Mechanism', 'causes', 'prevents', 'Negative_correlation', 'possible', 'complicates', 'decrease', 'reveals', 'worsen', 'Interacts_with']"

"In fact, changes in the function of gut microecology and gut microbiota may cause the occurrence and exacerbation of various diseases. It was found that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota may lead to decreased cardiac function and increased cardiomyopathy as well as cardiac insufficiency, which is of great significance in predicting CVDs and also has important predictive significance for the prognosis of adverse cardiovascular events. The gut microbiota has been reported to be associated with CVDs and its corresponding risk factors, such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, and insulin resistance. These risk factors may affect the composition and the diversity of gut microbiota. In addition, gut dysbiosis is also linked to inflammation, oxidative stress, platelet activity, thrombosis and atherosclerosis, which contribute to the progression of CVDs. The possible mechanism of gut microbiota dysbiosis related to CVDs includes its role in increasing intestinal permeability and triggering inflammation via the LPS/TLR4 as well as NLRP3 pathways, thereby ultimately contributing to the development of CVDs. In short, the inflammation directly triggers by gut microbiota is one of the possible mechanisms of CVDs susceptibility, and material metabolism affected by gut microbiota was proposed to play a role as well.",17039945.0,489,491,dysbiosis,893.0,902.0,Disease,990.0,1002.0,inflammation,Disease,causes,Disease$Disease,"['None', 'possible', 'part_of', 'causes', 'Associated_with', 'Marker/Mechanism', 'affects', 'reveals', 'increase', 'worsen', 'presence', 'complicates']"

The death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta is characteristic of PD. This disease causes symptoms such as rest tremors, bradykinesia, muscular rigidity, and postural stability problems. Parkinson's disease is characterized not only by neurological disorders, but also by gastrointestinal disturbances, including nausea, constipation (affecting more than 70% of PD patients), vomiting, reduced colonic motility, and gut microbiota changes (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth among many others).

"Aromatic amino acids including tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine are metabolized into indole and phenols by certain intestinal anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, and Peptostreptococcus. Tryptophan is decomposed into indole, indoleacetic acid, indole-3-lactic acid, 3-methylindole (skatole) and other indole compounds under the action of tryptophanase. Tryptophanase is the key enzyme that generates indole. The activity of the enzyme is easily induced by the substrate tryptophan, so when the amount of tryptophan changes in the colonic environment, the content of indole will fluctuate greatly. Of note, the metabolic products of aromatic amino acids generated by gut microbiota have a great impact on the pathology of cardiometabolic diseases. For example, indole propionic acid is associated with insulin sensitivity and appears to reduce the risk of diabetes. Moreover, the gut microbiota metabolizes dietary tryptophan to indoxyl, which further generates indoxyl sulfate through sulfonation. Excessive accumulation of indoxyl sulfate causes cardiomyocyte damage and increases thrombus formation. Another phenol compound, 4-methylphenol, can inhibit the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into mature adipocytes, induce apoptosis and reduce glucose uptake. In addition, benzoic acid is an aromatic carboxylic acid synthesized by colonic microorganisms by metabolizing dietary aromatic compounds.

"The origins of Parkinson's disease are the result of many factors such as increased age, polygenic factors (disease-segregating mutations in alpha-synuclein protein occurring in 15% of PD patients), toxins, and infectious agents. In 2006, Braak et al. assumed the gut-related origins of Parkinson's disease. One of the key pathological hallmarks of PD is Lewy bodies, being eosinophilic inclusion forms of misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates. Importantly, alpha-synuclein protein has a tendency to misfold and form aggregates. Its accumulation has been detected during bacterial and viral infections in the gut. Moreover, it can be recognized as a characteristic indicator of PD neural degeneration. This protein aggregate can boost the local immune response. Interestingly, alpha-synuclein deposition has been confirmed in the neurons of the intestinal submucosa, together with a possibility of the alpha-synuclein transport to the brain via the vagus nerve (translocation of prion-like proteins). Misfolded alpha-synuclein triggers neuronal dysfunction and progressive degeneration, thereby enabling disease progression.

"Experimental research confirms the hypothesis regarding SCFA reduction in autoimmune diseases (MS among others) and altered gut microbiota. A low level of SCFAs dysregulates Treg cell functions, leading to insufficient immune tolerance towards endogenous components and enteric microbiota. However, this process can be reversed by SCFAs supplementation (e.g., propionic acid). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing NFkappaB activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation and on microglial cells in vitro. TUDCA binds to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) expressed in microglial cells. This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS). Experimental results demonstrated that TUDCA acted as a double-edged sword, triggering microglia enhancement in anti-inflammatory and alternatively activated markers and on the other hand reducing the infiltration of macrophages and microglia with expressed pro-inflammatory markers. Interestingly, during neuroinflammation, microglial cells change their morphology, converting themselves into reactive macrophage-like forms. However, microglial cells are flexible, as they can sometimes polarize towards alternatively activated phenotypes, promoting CNS pathologies (proinflammatory or M1 microglia), or exert anti-inflammatory effects, boosting cell repair and remodeling. Bile acids were identified as nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor agonists, leading to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) depletion (in a mouse model) and neuroinflammatory process adjustment. The administration of the complex probiotic positively influenced the intestinal flora balance in patients diagnosed with MS. The probiotic prevented the onset of dysbiosis, significantly increasing the amount of Methanobrevibacter and Akkermansia, Prevotella, and Sutterella in MS patients, influencing gene expression and the production of beneficial bacterial metabolites.",16224291.0,ElL_9bC166,pYwHIUfPkw,IL-4Ralpha,1317.0,1327.0,Species,1285.0,1294.0,cytokines,Species,Associated_with,Species$Species,"['None', 'part_of', 'increase', 'experiences', 'affects', 'Associated_with', 'start', 'improve', 'Location_of', 'presence', 'possible', 'decrease', 'worsen', 'Interacts_with', 'treats']"
"In addition, phosphatidylcholine can be hydrolyzed into choline in the intestine in vivo, and the gut microbiota can convert choline into trimethylamine (TMA). After being absorbed by the intestinal tract, TMA is further transported to the liver and oxidized into TMAO by liver flavin monooxygenase 3 (FMO3), which plays an important role in human health and CVDs. TMAO also reduces reverse cholesterol transportation, and changes BAs composition. Some studies genetically manipulated hepatic FMO3 to modulate lipid homeostasis, suggesting a major role of gut microbiota in lipid metabolism. Furthermore, changes in TMAO levels have been found in metabolic diseases such as fatty liver and hyperlipidemia, suggesting that lipid metabolism mediated by gut microbiota plays an important role in the occurrence and development of diseases.",17118299.0,dZSR-ogzm1,xgTZbq4GdG,TMAO,264.0,268.0,Chemical,240.0,245.0,liver,Cellline,Location_of,Chemical$Cellline,"['improve', 'Interacts_with', 'None', 'Associated_with', 'decrease', 'worsen', 'Location_of', 'increase', 'affects', 'start', 'Physically_related_to', 'causes']"
"In addition to the clear relationship between gut microbiota and the occurrence of obesity, gut microbiota has also been associated with the development and prognosis in patients with diabetes.

"BAs, as by-products of cholesterol metabolism, are the main organic component of bile and are synthesized in hepatocytes. Cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) are primary BAs directly synthesized from cholesterol; secondary BAs include deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholic acid (LCA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and their glycine and taurine conjugated forms. BAs are excreted into the intestine to aid in the digestion and absorption of lipids and combine with farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and takeda-G-protein receptor 5 (TGR5) (Fig. 2). There is a strong biochemical relationship between BAs and gut microbiota. Some gut microbiota in healthy people can convert conjugated BAs into free BAs, and can transform BAs into secondary BAs with the help of bile salt hydrolase (BSH) and cholesterol 7-alpha hydroxy-lase (CYP7A1), so as to reduce blood cholesterol by affecting the enterohepatic circulation of BAs. Besides, the gut microbiota affects the metabolism of BAs by regulating the activity of BSH to reduce LDL cholesterol levels. BAs have bacteriostatic properties and an antimicrobial effect. BAs destroy the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane and thereby change the intestinal microecology. BAs also prevent bacteria from overgrowth and decrease inflammation. More importantly, BAs are also closely associated with CVDs. For example, BAs levels in the feces of patients with CVDs are different from those in healthy individuals. And BAs have been reported to regulate vascular tension and affect ion exchange on cardiomyocyte membranes, suggesting that regulating BAs by gut microbiota might be a treatment for CVDs.",17301489.0,883,KAUXKWaQLF,CYP7A1,828.0,834.0,Chemical,724.0,727.0,BAs,Chemical,affects,Chemical$Chemical,"['affects', 'Associated_with', 'part_of', 'None', 'improve', 'Physically_related_to', 'possible', 'start', 'increase', 'decrease', 'Location_of', 'Interacts_with', 'prevents', 'worsen']"
"Experimental research confirms the hypothesis regarding SCFA reduction in autoimmune diseases (MS among others) and altered gut microbiota. A low level of SCFAs dysregulates Treg cell functions, leading to insufficient immune tolerance towards endogenous components and enteric microbiota. However, this process can be reversed by SCFAs supplementation (e.g., propionic acid). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing NFkappaB activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation and on microglial cells in vitro. TUDCA binds to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) expressed in microglial cells. This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS). Experimental results demonstrated that TUDCA acted as a double-edged sword, triggering microglia enhancement in anti-inflammatory and alternatively activated markers and on the other hand reducing the infiltration of macrophages and microglia with expressed pro-inflammatory markers. Interestingly, during neuroinflammation, microglial cells change their morphology, converting themselves into reactive macrophage-like forms. However, microglial cells are flexible, as they can sometimes polarize towards alternatively activated phenotypes, promoting CNS pathologies (proinflammatory or M1 microglia), or exert anti-inflammatory effects, boosting cell repair and remodeling. Bile acids were identified as nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor agonists, leading to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) depletion (in a mouse model) and neuroinflammatory process adjustment. The administration of the complex probiotic positively influenced the intestinal flora balance in patients diagnosed with MS. The probiotic prevented the onset of dysbiosis, significantly increasing the amount of Methanobrevibacter and Akkermansia, Prevotella, and Sutterella in MS patients, influencing gene expression and the production of beneficial bacterial metabolites.",16224291.0,1281,IR7wlpzCQQ,TUDCA,766.0,771.0,Chemical,941.0,958.0,neuroinflammation,Disease,prevents,Chemical$Disease,"['improve', 'increase', 'Associated_with', 'affects', 'None', 'treats', 'Marker/Mechanism', 'causes', 'prevents', 'Negative_correlation', 'possible', 'complicates', 'decrease', 'reveals', 'worsen', 'Interacts_with']"

"Previous results have indicated that the metabolic regulation of BAs may be associated with T2D but the specific changes in BAs and the related mechanisms remain to be studied. It is also unclear how the different types of BAs change in patients with T2D. A study also suggested that patients with T2D had no change in plasma total BAs, but had an increase in DCA and a decrease in CDCA in plasma. Another study found that the plasma total BA concentration in patients with T2D was not significantly different from that of healthy people; however, the concentration of DCA in the plasma of patients with T2D was significantly higher than that of healthy controls. The mechanism may be that FXR and TGR5 are inhibited during insulin resistance, and the most effective natural ligands of the receptors, DCA and CA, are compensatorily increased. Besides, circulating BAs levels including DCA, TCA, TDCA, and glycodeoxycholic acid, are positively associated with the risk of T2D, while taurohyodeoxycholic acid is negatively associated with diabetes.

"At the end of this chapter, it is worth mentioning the fact that the interaction between the microbiome and the host is bidirectional, and some metabolic changes, which could be a pathological result of disease progression, also influence microbiome metabolism. A good example is a disturbance in cholesterol homeostasis, which correlates with an augmented probability of Alzheimer's disease occurrence. In addition, alteration of the intestinal microbiota composition with the subsequent fluctuations in the serum and brain levels of bile acids (BAs) is involved in the development of AD. BAs can act as detergents, affecting BBB permeability, and incrementing brain influx of peripheral cholesterol and BAs. Therefore, proper cholesterol elimination pathways play a crucial role in AD prevention and treatment. The gut microbiome is a main ""organ"" metabolizing secondary bile acids. Peripheral cholesterol is eliminated mainly through its liver conversion to BAs.

"The origins of Parkinson's disease are the result of many factors such as increased age, polygenic factors (disease-segregating mutations in alpha-synuclein protein occurring in 15% of PD patients), toxins, and infectious agents. In 2006, Braak et al. assumed the gut-related origins of Parkinson's disease. One of the key pathological hallmarks of PD is Lewy bodies, being eosinophilic inclusion forms of misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates. Importantly, alpha-synuclein protein has a tendency to misfold and form aggregates. Its accumulation has been detected during bacterial and viral infections in the gut. Moreover, it can be recognized as a characteristic indicator of PD neural degeneration. This protein aggregate can boost the local immune response. Interestingly, alpha-synuclein deposition has been confirmed in the neurons of the intestinal submucosa, together with a possibility of the alpha-synuclein transport to the brain via the vagus nerve (translocation of prion-like proteins). Misfolded alpha-synuclein triggers neuronal dysfunction and progressive degeneration, thereby enabling disease progression. Additionally, alpha-synuclein deposition in CNS is associated with intestinal hyperpermeability, TLRs, and pro-inflammatory cytokine overexpression. Animal models showed that alpha-synuclein aggregation in PD is associated with disorders of lipid metabolism, especially concerning phospholipids and sphingolipids.",16172163.0,885,m-P3DiOMNz,degeneration,1072.0,1084.0,Disease,211.0,228.0,infectious agents,Chemical,None,Disease$Chemical,"['decrease', 'affects', 'increase', 'start', 'None', 'Associated_with', 'Location_of', 'possible', 'stop']"
"The bacteria living in the human gut are also called commensals. Some beneficial commensal microbes could repair the normal function of the intestinal barrier and exert anti-inflammatory effects, such as Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila), Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Roseburia intestinalis, et al. . These commensal microbes make up about 20% of the total gut microbiota. They are indispensable for maintaining the physiological function of adult tissues and organs by synthesizing a variety of vitamins, participating in food digestion, producing lactic acid, promoting intestinal peristalsis, inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microbiota, and activating the immune system. For example, one of the most important commensal microbes in the human gut is Bifidobacterium, a strictly anaerobic gram-positive bacterium, which assists the human body in the digestion and absorption of nutrients, resists the invasion of harmful bacteria, improves the immune function of the body, secretes molecules to regulate immune function, and participates in the metabolism of substances in the intestine. Besides, another common commensal microbe, A. muciniphila, a gram-positive bacterium, reduces insulin sensitivity and is inversely associated with the development of obesity and diabetes. Furthermore, Clostridium butyricum can produce butyric acid, improve insulin sensitivity, produce satiety, and reduce the content of adipose tissue.",16619228.0,132,121,Clostridium butyricum,1306.0,1327.0,Species,1340.0,1352.0,butyric acid,Chemical,start,Species$Chemical,"['None', 'Associated_with', 'start', 'affects', 'Negative_correlation', 'Interacts_with', 'possible', 'part_of', 'improve', 'decrease', 'Location_of', 'increase', 'presence', 'experiences', 'worsen']"
"It is well known that the balance of cholesterol is closely related to human health, and disorder of cholesterol balance leads to cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. For example, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is ingested by macrophages to form foam cells and eventually leads to atherosclerosis, while high-density lipoprotein (HDL) can promote reverse cholesterol transport and play a cardiovascular protective role.

"It has been proven that risk factors for civilization diseases such as stroke and cardiovascular diseases are also associated with the diversity of the intestinal flora. The abovementioned factors comprise atherosclerosis and hypertension. Moreover, the dysregulation of microbiota was observed in patients with stroke together with increased plasma and urinary concentrations of the proatherosclerotic gut bacterial metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), also co-responsible for the development of cardiovascular diseases (atherosclerotic coronary artery disease among others), AD, and gestational diabetes. TMAO is produced from dietary phosphatidylcholine by the intestinal microbiota. Preclinical models of cerebral ischemia indicate the coexistence of pathological microflora which negatively affect intestinal permeability and motility. Some reported experimental results indicate the relationship of intestinal microbiota with neuroinflammatory processes by modulating intestinal T-cell trafficking to the CNS.

"The health of the gut microbiome can vary depending on various factors including diet (e.g., ingestion of saturated/unsaturated dietary fats, vitamins, minerals, dairy products, alcoholic beverages, polyphenols containing food such as cocoa-rich chocolate, tea, or coffee), dietary patterns, geographical area, and diet-related habits (sometimes varying between males and females) and sex (the influence of sex hormones). A positive correlation between polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (N-3 PUFA), and alpha-linolenic acid (aLNA) ingestion and protection against PD development in dose-response trends was demonstrated. American studies demonstrated that PUFA replacement with increased animal fat intake (Western Diet) significantly increased the risk of PD in males only. Excessive animal fat intake can promote dysbiosis and the production of harmful microbial metabolites, which can increase the prevalence of the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, sex differences are implicated in the mental health and prevalence of psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, and neurodegenerative disorders. It has been demonstrated that PD patients usually have altered microbiome compositions compared with controls. Similar to AD, many sex differences in PD are correlated with the protective nature of estrogens, as they are impacted by the gut-brain axis and protect against oxidative damage, thereby supporting dopaminergic function. It has been demonstrated that at age 45, the estimated overall lifetime risk for AD is about 20% for females and 10% for males, which is followed by a disruption in the patient's gut microbiota composition.

Specific species such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii have been observed to produce anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, thus alleviating inflammation and increasing insulin sensitivity. And some intestinal bacteria from other genera have been reported to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, which may increase the development of insulin resistance. In short, the dysbiosis of gut microbiota would lead to the damaged function of beta-cell and islet chronic inflammatory response by changing the component of SCFAs, BCAAs, and BAs, thereby affecting glucose and fat metabolism, eventually leading to the occurrence of diabetes.",18119457.0,1841,wYomUMp6cv,Faecalibacterium prausnitzii,174.0,202.0,Species,322.0,329.0,insulin,Species,improve,Species$Species,"['None', 'part_of', 'increase', 'experiences', 'affects', 'Associated_with', 'start', 'improve', 'Location_of', 'presence', 'possible', 'decrease', 'worsen', 'Interacts_with', 'treats']"
"It is currently controversial whether supplementation with BCAAs would increase circulating BCAAs, thereby increasing the risk of diabetes. And reducing BCAAs intake promotes fat mass loss and insulin sensitivity in mice with obesity. A high BCAAs diet causes excessive feeding, mainly due to excessive appetite. Adding threonine to balance the composition of amino acids in the diet can inhibit food intake. Nevertheless, some studies have found that supplementary BCAAs, such as isoleucine and leucine, can improve insulin resistance and reduce weight to lower the risk of obesity and diabetes. The inconsistency may be due to the individual state of energy excess or energy deficiency. In terms of an excessive energy state, such as in patients with obesity or diabetes who have an impaired ability to degrade BCAAs, BCAAs and related metabolites accumulate in circulation to reduce insulin sensitivity and cause insulin resistance. In most elderly people with inadequate energy or athletes who maintain good fitness habits, BCAAs can improve the form of metabolism. In these people, BCAAs decomposition metabolism is increased by regulatory factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha coactivator (PGC-1alpha) and PPARalpha, so that BCAAs levels are maintained in a steady state, which ultimately promotes glucose intake and insulin sensitivity. This was supported by the study of Newgard, who pointed out that dietary intake of BCAAs might interact with a high-fat diet to induce abnormal metabolic phenotypes such as insulin resistance. Mice fed BCAAs alone did not develop insulin resistance. However, when mice were fed a high-fat diet supplemented with BCAAs, they developed insulin resistance. This study suggested that BCAAs only lead to insulin resistance in the presence of excess energy intake. Therefore, more studies are needed to explore the supplementation with BCAAs and insulin resistance as well as the development of cardiovascular risk factors.",19341206.0,2451,2450,isoleucine,481.0,491.0,Chemical,466.0,471.0,BCAAs,Chemical,part_of,Chemical$Chemical,"['affects', 'Associated_with', 'part_of', 'None', 'improve', 'Physically_related_to', 'possible', 'start', 'increase', 'decrease', 'Location_of', 'Interacts_with', 'prevents', 'worsen']"
"Contrarily, as a positive example, balanced diets (i.e., Mediterranean diet and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) can be mentioned. Diets abundant in natural compounds with anti-inflammatory activity, antioxidants, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and plant-origin nutrients (proteins, polyphenols, vitamins, and fibers), together with reduced caloric intake, such as the Mediterranean diet, are correlated with a lower risk of dementia, decrease age-related cognitive deterioration, and the risk of neurodegeneration occurrence. Moreover, the Mediterranean diet increases the amount of gut Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus and reduces malignant bacteria belonging to Clostridium and Bacteroides, thereby improving memory and cognitive processes in healthy females after menopause and disorder patients. Additionally, following such a diet significantly reduces amyloid aggregation and therefore the frequency of amyloid-related diseases in the aging population.

It has been reported that butyrate and other SCFAs can cross the gastrointestinal endothelium and can pass through the BBB (exploiting active membrane transporters) and inhibit histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1).

"Besides the propagation of an inflammatory state, microbial endotoxins are probably involved in AD's inflammatory amyloidosis. Metagenomics analysis showed that patients suffering from cognitive dysfunctions related to amyloidosis demonstrated elevated amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neurotoxic compounds. In these patients, increased inflammation was probably related to Eubacterium deficiency, and an overabundance of gram-negative Escherichia and Shigella species, which are known amyloid producers. They manufacture ""curli"" amyloid fibers, accumulated extracellularly through an elaborated system. Further studies revealed that the overproduction of Abeta plaques is correlated with excessive growth of Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycobacterium and Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus spp.. Galloway et al. found Abeta in small intestine epithelial cells, suggesting that gut-derived amyloids could be absorbed and finally reach systemic circulation, where they can act as pro-inflammatory factors and trigger fibrillogenesis.

"Insufficient dietary fiber intake is considered to be an important risk factor for diabetes. The decrease in the production of SCFAs counts for an important reason here. Modulation of dietary SCFAs is thought to reshape the gut microbiota in diabetes and ameliorate diabetes. SCFAs increase fatty acid oxidation and energy expenditure to decrease the risk of suffering from T2D. Of note, T2D patients have lower levels of butyrate-generating bacteria. Butyrate could promote the secretion of postprandial insulin; and the increase in fecal propionic acid was associated with an increase in T2D risk. In oral glucose tolerance test, a high butyrate-producing microbiota was associated with an improved insulin response (indicating improved beta-cell function), and butyrate concentration was directly related to postprandial insulin sensitivity. Besides, in signal transduction regulation, butyrate could also inhibit HDAC expression in juvenile diabetic rats to modulate the p38/ERK/MAPK signaling pathway, which ultimately prevents beta-cell apoptosis and improves glucose homeostasis.",18120409.0,rCcJvHMuYM,OMVR9Lr-Rf,fecal propionic acid,534.0,554.0,Chemical,590.0,598.0,T2D risk,Disease,Associated_with,Chemical$Disease,"['improve', 'increase', 'Associated_with', 'affects', 'None', 'treats', 'Marker/Mechanism', 'causes', 'prevents', 'Negative_correlation', 'possible', 'complicates', 'decrease', 'reveals', 'worsen', 'Interacts_with']"

"Several studies have suggested that different BAs profiles are closely related to obesity. It was reported that 12-hydroxylated (12-OH) BAs such as CA and DCA increase obesity susceptibility, while non-12-OH BAs such as CDCA, UDCA and LCA reduce obesity susceptibility. Mice with higher levels of non-12-OH BAs gained weight slowly and had less metabolic disturbance, while the rapidly gaining weight mice had significantly lower levels of non-12-OH BAs such as UDCA. UDCA intake significantly reduced weight gain and metabolic disturbances induced by high-fat diet. Another study also provided evidence that a high-fat diet caused obesity by increasing the levels of 12-OH BAs. In a rat model, high-fat diet caused increases in the total BAs, DCA and taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA) in plasma and liver tissues, and increases in DCA in intestinal tissues and feces.

"BAs, as by-products of cholesterol metabolism, are the main organic component of bile and are synthesized in hepatocytes. Cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) are primary BAs directly synthesized from cholesterol; secondary BAs include deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholic acid (LCA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and their glycine and taurine conjugated forms. BAs are excreted into the intestine to aid in the digestion and absorption of lipids and combine with farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and takeda-G-protein receptor 5 (TGR5) (Fig. 2). There is a strong biochemical relationship between BAs and gut microbiota. Some gut microbiota in healthy people can convert conjugated BAs into free BAs, and can transform BAs into secondary BAs with the help of bile salt hydrolase (BSH) and cholesterol 7-alpha hydroxy-lase (CYP7A1), so as to reduce blood cholesterol by affecting the enterohepatic circulation of BAs. Besides, the gut microbiota affects the metabolism of BAs by regulating the activity of BSH to reduce LDL cholesterol levels. BAs have bacteriostatic properties and an antimicrobial effect. BAs destroy the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane and thereby change the intestinal microecology. BAs also prevent bacteria from overgrowth and decrease inflammation. More importantly, BAs are also closely associated with CVDs. For example, BAs levels in the feces of patients with CVDs are different from those in healthy individuals. And BAs have been reported to regulate vascular tension and affect ion exchange on cardiomyocyte membranes, suggesting that regulating BAs by gut microbiota might be a treatment for CVDs.",17301489.0,aQMuBXupBn,KAUXKWaQLF,BSH,785.0,788.0,Chemical,724.0,727.0,BAs,Chemical,affects,Chemical$Chemical,"['affects', 'Associated_with', 'part_of', 'None', 'improve', 'Physically_related_to', 'possible', 'start', 'increase', 'decrease', 'Location_of', 'Interacts_with', 'prevents', 'worsen']"
"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal health condition caused by the progressive neural death of the spinal cord, brain stem, and motor cortex neurons, causing advanced weakness, paralysis, eating difficulties, and respiratory failure. One of the main signs of ALS is the accumulation of phosphorylated protein, which binds to DNA in the form of protein aggregates deposited in glia and motor neurons.

Changes in bacterial abundance and diversity correlate with ASL origins (as one of the environmental factors) together with impaired metabolism, immunological functions, and toxin accumulation, leading to brain damage. It has been demonstrated that Akkermansia muciniphila alleviates ALS symptoms, although Ruminococcus torques and Parabacteroides distasonis aggravate them.

"The gut microbiome is crucially engaged in the regulation and maintenance of human health and homeostasis, i.e., proper intestine motion, fibre digestion, regulating the development of host immunity, and exerting a protective effect against pathogenic factors (such as Campylobacter jejuni, Helicobacter pylori, and Clostridium difficile). The Irish ELDERMET study (Elderly to benefit from Research Project) demonstrated the correlation between intestinal microbiota diversity and health outcomes such as overall health, frailty, and proper immune functions, underlying the gut microbiota composition as a possible indicator of healthy ageing. Multiple studies showed the interplay between the intestinal microbiota and modulation of central nervous system (CNS) functions and neurodegeneration processes, pointing to the microbiome-gut-brain axis as one of the factors modulating host homeostasis in health and disease. In the past decade, the alterations of the gut microbiota, which are called dysbiosis, have been connected with the pathophysiology of numerous common diseases such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, gastrointestinal diseases, and cardiovascular events. Dysbiosis state is also implicated in neurological and neurodegenerative disorders such as autism, and Alzheimer's (AD) or Parkinson's (PD) diseases.

"Given that the gut microbiota is essential in human health, changes in the composition and function of the gut microbiota may result in the development of diseases. Due to the influence of host genes, diet, antibiotic use, lifestyle, drugs as well as other factors, the composition and diversity of gut microbiota gradually change with interindividual variation. For example, a high-fat diet leads to an increase in the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. When the composition and proportion of gut microbiota change, inflammation and metabolic abnormalities can be induced, which contribute to the development of different diseases. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota refers to changes in the number, species and composition of gut microbiota. In recent years, gut microbiota dysbiosis has been shown to be critically involved in health and has emerged as a potential pathogenesis for various diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, cancers, and CVDs. Moreover, gut dysbiosis is also a driver of metabolic inflammation and metabolic dysregulation, which serve as a key feature of metabolic diseases. For instance, the translocation of intestinal bacteria to the blood and liver through the portal venous system together with its metabolites are able to stimulate the release of inflammatory factors, and promote the occurrence of non-alcoholic fatty liver as well as hepatitis.

Furthermore, the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota triggers intestinal mucosal barrier damage, leading to inflammation and disordered nutrient metabolism.

Furthermore, the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota triggers intestinal mucosal barrier damage, leading to inflammation and disordered nutrient metabolism.

"SCFAs may prevent obesity by regulating the homeostasis of glucose and lipid metabolism. For instance, acetate decreases appetite and nutrient intake. Propionate activates intestinal gluconeogenesis by a gut-brain neural circuit to promote energy balance. Butyrate provides energy for colon cells, maintains the integrity of intestinal walls, and improves the insulin response, which activates gluconeogenesis to maintain the balance of glucose and energy through the cAMP pathway. And one study indicated that oral butyrate intake prevents obesity and insulin resistance. Furthermore, the role of SCFAs in metabolic hemostasis is related to other factors. Adenosine monophosphate activating protein (AMPK) is a heterotrimeric enzyme that stimulates liver and muscle fatty acid oxidation pathways. SCFAs promote the activity of AMPK and improve its ability to oxidize fatty acids. Last, SCFAs can affect the development of dyslipidemia. SCFAs increase the expression of fasting-induced adipose factor (FIAF), a circulating lipoprotein lipase inhibitor, by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-gamma), thereby decreasing the activity of lipoproteinases and inhibiting lipolysis in adipose tissues.

"At the end of this chapter, it is worth mentioning the fact that the interaction between the microbiome and the host is bidirectional, and some metabolic changes, which could be a pathological result of disease progression, also influence microbiome metabolism. A good example is a disturbance in cholesterol homeostasis, which correlates with an augmented probability of Alzheimer's disease occurrence. In addition, alteration of the intestinal microbiota composition with the subsequent fluctuations in the serum and brain levels of bile acids (BAs) is involved in the development of AD. BAs can act as detergents, affecting BBB permeability, and incrementing brain influx of peripheral cholesterol and BAs. Therefore, proper cholesterol elimination pathways play a crucial role in AD prevention and treatment. The gut microbiome is a main ""organ"" metabolizing secondary bile acids. Peripheral cholesterol is eliminated mainly through its liver conversion to BAs. The gut microbiota performs BA transformation via deconjugation and dehydroxylation, leading to secondary BA formation. Nho et al. investigated the correlation between neurodegeneration and BAs, B-amyloid, and tau protein concentration. The application of targeted metabolomics enabled the determination of the association between intestinal microbiota-derived secondary bile acids and sera BAs. Interestingly, the analysis indicated an imbalanced BA ratio, underlying an increased amount of secondary BAs over primary ones. Another clinical study confirmed the correlation between bile acid metabolic profile and the prevalence of AD and mild cognitive impairment, showing similar BA ratio disruptions. Decreased cognitive functions were positively associated with increased concentrations of secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid, and glycolithocholic acid. The described results suggested the involvement of the pathological gut microbiota in AD development; however, still it requires more in-depth studies.",16559364.0,772,789,bile acids,873.0,883.0,Chemical,1598.0,1600.0,AD,Disease,None,Chemical$Disease,"['improve', 'increase', 'Associated_with', 'affects', 'None', 'treats', 'Marker/Mechanism', 'causes', 'prevents', 'Negative_correlation', 'possible', 'complicates', 'decrease', 'reveals', 'worsen', 'Interacts_with']"
"It remains unclear how the gut microbiota and BAs profiles interact with each other and whether the interaction is associated with obesity. Mice fed BAs exhibited obesity and a composition change in the obesity-associated gut microbiota, which is similar to high-fat diet-fed mice. Under a high-fat diet, the concentration of intestinal BAs increases, and the composition of gut microbiota alternates. For example, the increased BAs are the main reason for the marked increase in the abundance of the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. Another study has shown that BAs and a high-fat diet promote the growth of Bilophila wadsworthia in mice, and secondary BAs produced by Bilophila spp. have been shown to induce obesity. What's more, it has been reported that the low capacity of microbiota to metabolize Tauro-beta-muricholic acid, a primary BA, might increase the risk of obesity and insulin resistance. Therefore, BAs profiles affect the composition of gut microbiota, and gut microbiota also regulates the production and ratio of different BAs to play an important role in obesity susceptibility.",18109315.0,1617,1618,obesity,1078.0,1085.0,Disease,140.0,144.0,Mice,Species,None,Disease$Species,"['affects', 'None', 'decrease', 'increase', 'Associated_with', 'Negative_correlation', 'worsen', 'possible', 'presence', 'causes', 'part_of']"
"BAs, as by-products of cholesterol metabolism, are the main organic component of bile and are synthesized in hepatocytes. Cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) are primary BAs directly synthesized from cholesterol; secondary BAs include deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholic acid (LCA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and their glycine and taurine conjugated forms. BAs are excreted into the intestine to aid in the digestion and absorption of lipids and combine with farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and takeda-G-protein receptor 5 (TGR5) (Fig. 2). There is a strong biochemical relationship between BAs and gut microbiota. Some gut microbiota in healthy people can convert conjugated BAs into free BAs, and can transform BAs into secondary BAs with the help of bile salt hydrolase (BSH) and cholesterol 7-alpha hydroxy-lase (CYP7A1), so as to reduce blood cholesterol by affecting the enterohepatic circulation of BAs. Besides, the gut microbiota affects the metabolism of BAs by regulating the activity of BSH to reduce LDL cholesterol levels. BAs have bacteriostatic properties and an antimicrobial effect. BAs destroy the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane and thereby change the intestinal microecology. BAs also prevent bacteria from overgrowth and decrease inflammation. More importantly, BAs are also closely associated with CVDs. For example, BAs levels in the feces of patients with CVDs are different from those in healthy individuals. And BAs have been reported to regulate vascular tension and affect ion exchange on cardiomyocyte membranes, suggesting that regulating BAs by gut microbiota might be a treatment for CVDs.",17301489.0,BdrR2NBTgP,3PVUVBgpdq,CA,135.0,137.0,Chemical,176.0,187.0,primary BAs,Chemical,part_of,Chemical$Chemical,"['affects', 'Associated_with', 'part_of', 'None', 'improve', 'Physically_related_to', 'possible', 'start', 'increase', 'decrease', 'Location_of', 'Interacts_with', 'prevents', 'worsen']"
"During PD development, microbiota changes can be accompanied by reduced concentrations of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and aromatic amino-acids in comparison with the healthy control group. It has been demonstrated that the alteration of the metabolites occurred, especially during disease progression. Experimental results indicate the correlation between PD and mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, the lower levels of BCAAs and aromatic amino acids have been observed in stool samples during this period in comparison with the healthy control group, indicating a dysbiosis state in the gut microbiota. Moreover, the PD-disrupted gut microbiome may negatively influence the level of methionine in human plasma.",16207438.0,1033,1029,PD,7.0,9.0,Disease,129.0,149.0,aromatic amino-acids,Chemical,decrease,Disease$Chemical,"['decrease', 'affects', 'increase', 'start', 'None', 'Associated_with', 'Location_of', 'possible', 'stop']"
"Importantly, studies found that the occurrence of CVDs was also involved in the immune response mediated by the NLR family. For example, atherosclerotic plaques in LDLR-/- NOD 1/2-/- mice showed less lipid deposition and macrophage aggregation, suggesting that lack of NOD 1/2 may reduce the occurrence of atherosclerosis. Moreover, the peptidoglycan components in bacteria can bind to NOD1 and NOD2, which in turn mediate the occurrence of the inflammatory response, and further leads to atherosclerosis. Besides, inflammation induced by the NLRP3 inflammasome plays a role in the interaction between gut microbiota and cardiometabolic diseases. For instance, the NLRP3 deficient obese mice had altered composition of the gut microbiota, decreased TMAO and LPS levels, as well as downregulated hepatic steatosis and myocardial energy metabolism. Nevertheless, another study reported that NOD TLR4 -/- mice developed higher body weight, hyperlipidemia, severe insulin, and glucose intolerance, lower circulating SCFAs levels, higher levels of Bacteroidetes, lower levels of Firmicutes in the large intestine, as well as fewer SCFAs-associated gut microbiota, all of which may promote the development of insulin-deficient diabetes.",16855003.0,kif1r6lvZq,_eHysBuPsi,NOD TLR4,889.0,897.0,Gene,953.0,967.0,severe insulin,Disease,Negative_correlation,Gene$Disease,"['Associated_with', 'start', 'Negative_correlation', 'increase', 'causes', 'None']"

"As previously mentioned, the microbiome is able to produce SCFAs. Its indirect influence on Alzheimer's disease progression has been reported in multiple studies.

"The PD microbiome has a diminished variety of bacterial taxonomic groups, especially the ones associated with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects and the increase of phyla, which has toxic effects. Predominantly, the reduction was observed in the Lachnospiraceae family, including Butyrivibrio, Pseudobutyrivibrio, Coprococcus, Blautia and SCFAs-producing Prevotellaceae. The increased amount of Enterobacteriaceae is linked to the severity of postural instability and walking difficulties. Moreover, the PD microbiome is characterised by increased Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium species and decreased amount of Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae. The overgrowth of Akkermansia spp. in PD patients may be strain-specific and can be related to immune-response alterations, decreased mucus thicknesses, and increased constipation. Faecalibacterium family is a crucial player producing SCFAs and anti-inflammatory metabolites, maintaining gut health. Faecalibacterium balance disturbances can lead to impaired gut-barrier function, increasing the risk of infection with enteric pathogens and boosting alpha-synuclein formation. Similarly, the Lachnospiraceae family can produce butyrate, important for the proper function of the gut epithelium. Decreased Lachnospiraceae quantity might aggravate gut inflammation, stimulate toxin production, and damage the integrity of the gut epithelial barrier. PD patients' intestinal microflora were characterised by a diminished abundance of Lachnospiraceae, which was positively correlated with PD progress, cognitive decline, and impaired motor functions. These microbiome's compositional changes correlate well with some metabolic switches. PD microbiota show reduced SCFAs production, decreased carbohydrate fermentation, and augmented proteolytic fermentation. Chen et al. demonstrated that the SCFA level was relevant to microbiota composition changes and the clinical severity of PD. The levels of SCFAs acetate, butyrate, and propionate in fecal samples of PD patients were significantly reduced, contrary to their elevated concentration in plasma. Rodent models of PD disease have shown a positive effect of SCFAs on behavior and PD symptoms. Butyrate, as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, exerts neuroprotective activity, reducing dopaminergic cell death, and motor impairment, and improving cognitive functions. Taken together, SCFAs play an important role in protection from PD disease and could be proposed as representative gut-oriented indicators for diversifying individuals with PD and placing disease progression.",16553034.0,1008,FBJfPTjELV,Faecalibacterium,961.0,977.0,Species,1011.0,1040.0,impaired gut-barrier function,Disease,causes,Species$Disease,"['Negative_correlation', 'prevents', 'experiences', 'possible', 'causes', 'Associated_with', 'decrease', 'None', 'improve', 'Marker/Mechanism', 'increase', 'affects', 'treats', 'start', 'complicates', 'Interacts_with']"
"Aromatic amino acids including tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine are metabolized into indole and phenols by certain intestinal anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, and Peptostreptococcus. Tryptophan is decomposed into indole, indoleacetic acid, indole-3-lactic acid, 3-methylindole (skatole) and other indole compounds under the action of tryptophanase. Tryptophanase is the key enzyme that generates indole. The activity of the enzyme is easily induced by the substrate tryptophan, so when the amount of tryptophan changes in the colonic environment, the content of indole will fluctuate greatly. Of note, the metabolic products of aromatic amino acids generated by gut microbiota have a great impact on the pathology of cardiometabolic diseases. For example, indole propionic acid is associated with insulin sensitivity and appears to reduce the risk of diabetes. Moreover, the gut microbiota metabolizes dietary tryptophan to indoxyl, which further generates indoxyl sulfate through sulfonation. Excessive accumulation of indoxyl sulfate causes cardiomyocyte damage and increases thrombus formation. Another phenol compound, 4-methylphenol, can inhibit the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into mature adipocytes, induce apoptosis and reduce glucose uptake. In addition, benzoic acid is an aromatic carboxylic acid synthesized by colonic microorganisms by metabolizing dietary aromatic compounds.

Of note, the metabolic products of aromatic amino acids generated by gut microbiota have a great impact on the pathology of cardiometabolic diseases. For example, indole propionic acid is associated with insulin sensitivity and appears to reduce the risk of diabetes. Moreover, the gut microbiota metabolizes dietary tryptophan to indoxyl, which further generates indoxyl sulfate through sulfonation. Excessive accumulation of indoxyl sulfate causes cardiomyocyte damage and increases thrombus formation. Another phenol compound, 4-methylphenol, can inhibit the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into mature adipocytes, induce apoptosis and reduce glucose uptake. In addition, benzoic acid is an aromatic carboxylic acid synthesized by colonic microorganisms by metabolizing dietary aromatic compounds. Plasma benzoic acid levels were found to be elevated in the rat model of polygenic diabetes.",17445219.0,LtYRrKQO1i,1056,gut microbiota,937.0,951.0,Species,986.0,993.0,indoxyl,Chemical,affects,Species$Chemical,"['None', 'Associated_with', 'start', 'affects', 'Negative_correlation', 'Interacts_with', 'possible', 'part_of', 'improve', 'decrease', 'Location_of', 'increase', 'presence', 'experiences', 'worsen']"
"Alzheimer's disease (AD), commonly known as senile dementia, is a chronic, devastating, neurodegenerative, and neuroinflammatory disorder with rising incidence and is considered to be the most frequent form of dementia in aging individuals (caused by aberrant protein processing, trafficking, and aggregation in neural cells). The World Alzheimer Report indicates that 50 million people suffer from AD-related neurological problems and this number will increase to 152 million in 2050. It is predicted that in 2030 up to 66 million people will suffer from AD. AD is a multifactorial disease characterized by synapse loss, extracellular cerebral accumulation of insoluble peptides belonging to amyloid-beta (Abeta), the aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein inside the cells, neurofibrillary mass formation, neuronal death (in the neocortex and hippocampus), progressive memory deterioration, and cognition decline leading to dementia. AD is associated with more than 700 genetic and environmental risk factors. From the genetic point of view, one of the most important risk factors related to AD development is the incidence of a ""4 allele variant in the apolipoprotein"" (APOE4) gene, which is associated with cholesterol transport in CNS, and also contributes to metabolomic and taxonomic changes in the microbiome.",16422307.0,378,6m54L-jehE,dementia,210.0,218.0,Disease,251.0,278.0,aberrant protein processing,Disease,causes,Disease$Disease,"['None', 'possible', 'part_of', 'causes', 'Associated_with', 'Marker/Mechanism', 'affects', 'reveals', 'increase', 'worsen', 'presence', 'complicates']"
"In recent years, many researches demonstrated that gut microbiota could promote the development of cardiovascular risk factors and then further promotes the development of CVDs.

"Particularly, SCFAs also have anti-inflammatory functions. It was reported that the butyrate and propionate can inhibit the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and NF-kappaB signaling pathways. These may be because that SCFAs can inhibit the activity of HDAC, inactivate the NF-kappaB pathway and decrease the expression of interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-6, and TNF-alpha, which further control inflammation. Meanwhile, butyrate increases the acetylation of H3 histone in the Forkhead box protein P3 (FOXP3) promoter by inhibiting HDAC4, thus promoting Treg differentiation, affecting G1-phase-specific cyclins, and further resulting in the markedly inhibited proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, thereby inhibiting myocardial fibrosis and improving heart function.",17066164.0,Vq4BEbC5E6,763,SCFAs,212.0,217.0,Chemical,316.0,329.0,interleukin-2,Species,decrease,Chemical$Species,"['increase', 'None', 'Interacts_with', 'decrease', 'affects', 'part_of', 'improve', 'Associated_with', 'Physically_related_to', 'stop', 'Location_of', 'start', 'worsen']"

"The main end product of bacterial fermentation, and therefore the most predominant, is the SCFA propionic acid (PA), which positively influences CNS regeneration processes such as remyelination (due to the former increase of the amount of intestinal T regulatory cells and protecting against the white matter and axonal loss). Hoyles et al. demonstrated the contribution of propionate to the BBB integrity and the modulation of gut-brain axis. BBB homeostasis and integrity are necessary for proper CNS development and function. Recently, a positive correlation between microbial-induced BBB dysfunction (barrier integrity disturbances followed by leakage) and disorders such as AD has been established. Another member of the SCFAs family, which has a documented influence on homeostasis and AD progression, is butyrate, an important driver of metabolic processes with the ability to influence intestinal macrophages, increasing immunomodulation and decreasing the histone deacetylase inhibition-mediated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Butyrate, as an SCFA, influences the immune response crossing the BBB and drives the maturation and metabolism of microglia cells. It regulates the secretion of gut hormones, such as glucagon-like peptide-1, which can improve hippocampus neuroplasticity.

"The health of the gut microbiome can vary depending on various factors including diet (e.g., ingestion of saturated/unsaturated dietary fats, vitamins, minerals, dairy products, alcoholic beverages, polyphenols containing food such as cocoa-rich chocolate, tea, or coffee), dietary patterns, geographical area, and diet-related habits (sometimes varying between males and females) and sex (the influence of sex hormones). A positive correlation between polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (N-3 PUFA), and alpha-linolenic acid (aLNA) ingestion and protection against PD development in dose-response trends was demonstrated. American studies demonstrated that PUFA replacement with increased animal fat intake (Western Diet) significantly increased the risk of PD in males only. Excessive animal fat intake can promote dysbiosis and the production of harmful microbial metabolites, which can increase the prevalence of the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, sex differences are implicated in the mental health and prevalence of psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, and neurodegenerative disorders. It has been demonstrated that PD patients usually have altered microbiome compositions compared with controls. Similar to AD, many sex differences in PD are correlated with the protective nature of estrogens, as they are impacted by the gut-brain axis and protect against oxidative damage, thereby supporting dopaminergic function. It has been demonstrated that at age 45, the estimated overall lifetime risk for AD is about 20% for females and 10% for males, which is followed by a disruption in the patient's gut microbiota composition.

"In the past decade, single dietary factors which can positively manipulate the gut microbiota-brain axis through microbiome modulation have gained significant attention. One of these factors is probiotic bacteria and/or prebiotics. Probiotics are defined as microbial organisms with a beneficial role in the host's health and homeostasis, which help to preserve digestive, metabolic, immune, and neuroendocrine functions. Naturally probiotic bacteria can be found in fermented food. Experimental results revealed that the administration of probiotics alone or in combination with prebiotics (fructooligosaccharides or galactooligosaccharides) improved the gastrointestinal barrier, which is the first line of ""defence"" from harmful factors occurring in food, and the microbiome. Probiotics and prebiotics are well-documented ""problem-solution"" for gastrointestinal diseases. Moreover, probiotics can reduce CNS inflammatory processes and activation of microglia, demonstrating promising potential for use in neurodegenerative diseases as ingestible ""psychobiotics"". Many studies indicate that the ingestion of probiotics can serve as a microbiological strategy against neurodegenerative diseases such as AD; however, the exact mechanism is under investigation. Experiments performed on mice underline the hypothesis that mechanisms related to neuroprotective effects of Bifidobacterium breve administration may be connected with neuroinflammation and cognition pathways, probably through the production of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) neurotransmitter and the regulation of the gut microbial composition. Clinical results of a randomized double-blind controlled trial revealed that 3-month exposure to Lactobacillus spp. And a Bifidobacterium bifidum ""cocktail"" enhanced cognitive functions and memory, as examined in a mini-mental state test.

Moreover, this observation has been confirmed in in vivo studies, where the injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharide into the brain imitates inflammatory and pathological features such as cognitive impairment and fibrillogenesis observed in AD.",16169659.0,641,647,Alzheimer,296.0,305.0,Disease,282.0,290.0,patients,Species,affects,Disease$Species,"['affects', 'None', 'decrease', 'increase', 'Associated_with', 'Negative_correlation', 'worsen', 'possible', 'presence', 'causes', 'part_of']"
"Previous results have indicated that the metabolic regulation of BAs may be associated with T2D but the specific changes in BAs and the related mechanisms remain to be studied. It is also unclear how the different types of BAs change in patients with T2D. A study also suggested that patients with T2D had no change in plasma total BAs, but had an increase in DCA and a decrease in CDCA in plasma. Another study found that the plasma total BA concentration in patients with T2D was not significantly different from that of healthy people; however, the concentration of DCA in the plasma of patients with T2D was significantly higher than that of healthy controls. The mechanism may be that FXR and TGR5 are inhibited during insulin resistance, and the most effective natural ligands of the receptors, DCA and CA, are compensatorily increased. Besides, circulating BAs levels including DCA, TCA, TDCA, and glycodeoxycholic acid, are positively associated with the risk of T2D, while taurohyodeoxycholic acid is negatively associated with diabetes. This may be due to the fact that hydrophobic BAs isoforms (such as DCA) have been shown to be involved in inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress with glucose dysregulation, and hydrophilic BAs isoforms (such as tauroursodeoxycholic acid) have been shown to prevent inflammation and enhance insulin sensitivity.",18340523.0,WXVWv_iZ6f,2047,hydrophilic BAs isoforms,1231.0,1255.0,Chemical,1344.0,1351.0,insulin,Species,improve,Chemical$Species,"['increase', 'None', 'Interacts_with', 'decrease', 'affects', 'part_of', 'improve', 'Associated_with', 'Physically_related_to', 'stop', 'Location_of', 'start', 'worsen']"

"It has been proven that risk factors for civilization diseases such as stroke and cardiovascular diseases are also associated with the diversity of the intestinal flora. The abovementioned factors comprise atherosclerosis and hypertension. Moreover, the dysregulation of microbiota was observed in patients with stroke together with increased plasma and urinary concentrations of the proatherosclerotic gut bacterial metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), also co-responsible for the development of cardiovascular diseases (atherosclerotic coronary artery disease among others), AD, and gestational diabetes. TMAO is produced from dietary phosphatidylcholine by the intestinal microbiota. Preclinical models of cerebral ischemia indicate the coexistence of pathological microflora which negatively affect intestinal permeability and motility. Some reported experimental results indicate the relationship of intestinal microbiota with neuroinflammatory processes by modulating intestinal T-cell trafficking to the CNS. Animal models of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury clearly pointed out the beneficial, neuroprotective effect of the administration of a probiotic containing the Clostridium butyricum bacterial strain on the prognosis of animals after a stroke.",16214272.0,1658,1656,atherosclerosis,206.0,221.0,Disease,71.0,77.0,stroke,Disease,part_of,Disease$Disease,"['None', 'possible', 'part_of', 'causes', 'Associated_with', 'Marker/Mechanism', 'affects', 'reveals', 'increase', 'worsen', 'presence', 'complicates']"
"In the past decade, single dietary factors which can positively manipulate the gut microbiota-brain axis through microbiome modulation have gained significant attention. One of these factors is probiotic bacteria and/or prebiotics. Probiotics are defined as microbial organisms with a beneficial role in the host's health and homeostasis, which help to preserve digestive, metabolic, immune, and neuroendocrine functions. Naturally probiotic bacteria can be found in fermented food. Experimental results revealed that the administration of probiotics alone or in combination with prebiotics (fructooligosaccharides or galactooligosaccharides) improved the gastrointestinal barrier, which is the first line of ""defence"" from harmful factors occurring in food, and the microbiome. Probiotics and prebiotics are well-documented ""problem-solution"" for gastrointestinal diseases. Moreover, probiotics can reduce CNS inflammatory processes and activation of microglia, demonstrating promising potential for use in neurodegenerative diseases as ingestible ""psychobiotics"". Many studies indicate that the ingestion of probiotics can serve as a microbiological strategy against neurodegenerative diseases such as AD; however, the exact mechanism is under investigation. Experiments performed on mice underline the hypothesis that mechanisms related to neuroprotective effects of Bifidobacterium breve administration may be connected with neuroinflammation and cognition pathways, probably through the production of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) neurotransmitter and the regulation of the gut microbial composition. Clinical results of a randomized double-blind controlled trial revealed that 3-month exposure to Lactobacillus spp. And a Bifidobacterium bifidum ""cocktail"" enhanced cognitive functions and memory, as examined in a mini-mental state test. It was demonstrated that Bifidobacterium breve exerts positive and unique activity in AD patients, improving cognitive functions and reducing neuroinflammation.

"The gut microbiota is critical to human health, such as digesting nutrients, forming the intestinal epithelial barrier, regulating immune function, producing vitamins and hormones, and producing metabolites to interact with the host. Meanwhile, increasing evidence indicates that the gut microbiota has a strong correlation with the occurrence, progression and treatment of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). In patients with CVDs and corresponding risk factors, the composition and ratio of gut microbiota have significant differences compared with their healthy counterparts. Therefore, gut microbiota dysbiosis, gut microbiota-generated metabolites, and the related signaling pathway may serve as explanations for some of the mechanisms about the occurrence and development of CVDs. Several studies have also demonstrated that many traditional and latest therapeutic treatments of CVDs are associated with the gut microbiota and its generated metabolites and related signaling pathways. Given that information, we summarized the latest advances in the current research regarding the effect of gut microbiota on health, the main cardiovascular risk factors, and CVDs, highlighted the roles and mechanisms of several metabolites, and introduced corresponding promising treatments for CVDs regarding the gut microbiota. Therefore, this review mainly focuses on exploring the role of gut microbiota related metabolites and their therapeutic potential in CVDs, which may eventually provide better solutions in the development of therapeutic treatment as well as the prevention of CVDs.",16509972.0,25,28,CVDs,1282.0,1286.0,Disease,34.0,39.0,human,Species,None,Disease$Species,"['affects', 'None', 'decrease', 'increase', 'Associated_with', 'Negative_correlation', 'worsen', 'possible', 'presence', 'causes', 'part_of']"
"BAs, as by-products of cholesterol metabolism, are the main organic component of bile and are synthesized in hepatocytes. Cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) are primary BAs directly synthesized from cholesterol; secondary BAs include deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholic acid (LCA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and their glycine and taurine conjugated forms. BAs are excreted into the intestine to aid in the digestion and absorption of lipids and combine with farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and takeda-G-protein receptor 5 (TGR5) (Fig. 2). There is a strong biochemical relationship between BAs and gut microbiota. Some gut microbiota in healthy people can convert conjugated BAs into free BAs, and can transform BAs into secondary BAs with the help of bile salt hydrolase (BSH) and cholesterol 7-alpha hydroxy-lase (CYP7A1), so as to reduce blood cholesterol by affecting the enterohepatic circulation of BAs. Besides, the gut microbiota affects the metabolism of BAs by regulating the activity of BSH to reduce LDL cholesterol levels. BAs have bacteriostatic properties and an antimicrobial effect. BAs destroy the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane and thereby change the intestinal microecology. BAs also prevent bacteria from overgrowth and decrease inflammation. More importantly, BAs are also closely associated with CVDs. For example, BAs levels in the feces of patients with CVDs are different from those in healthy individuals. And BAs have been reported to regulate vascular tension and affect ion exchange on cardiomyocyte membranes, suggesting that regulating BAs by gut microbiota might be a treatment for CVDs.",17301489.0,TqCyUhVcKM,Mzqkn65b6n,gut microbiota,935.0,949.0,Species,976.0,979.0,BAs,Chemical,affects,Species$Chemical,"['None', 'Associated_with', 'start', 'affects', 'Negative_correlation', 'Interacts_with', 'possible', 'part_of', 'improve', 'decrease', 'Location_of', 'increase', 'presence', 'experiences', 'worsen']"
"Particularly, SCFAs also have anti-inflammatory functions. It was reported that the butyrate and propionate can inhibit the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and NF-kappaB signaling pathways. These may be because that SCFAs can inhibit the activity of HDAC, inactivate the NF-kappaB pathway and decrease the expression of interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-6, and TNF-alpha, which further control inflammation. Meanwhile, butyrate increases the acetylation of H3 histone in the Forkhead box protein P3 (FOXP3) promoter by inhibiting HDAC4, thus promoting Treg differentiation, affecting G1-phase-specific cyclins, and further resulting in the markedly inhibited proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, thereby inhibiting myocardial fibrosis and improving heart function.",17066164.0,Vq4BEbC5E6,765,SCFAs,212.0,217.0,Chemical,338.0,342.0,IL-6,Species,decrease,Chemical$Species,"['increase', 'None', 'Interacts_with', 'decrease', 'affects', 'part_of', 'improve', 'Associated_with', 'Physically_related_to', 'stop', 'Location_of', 'start', 'worsen']"

Other researchers further found that Bifidobacterium brevis could reduce dextran sodium sulfate-induced apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells and reduce intestinal inflammation, which indicated that gut microbiota could protect intestinal mucosa by reducing apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells.

This disease causes symptoms such as rest tremors, bradykinesia, muscular rigidity, and postural stability problems. Parkinson's disease is characterized not only by neurological disorders, but also by gastrointestinal disturbances, including nausea, constipation (affecting more than 70% of PD patients), vomiting, reduced colonic motility, and gut microbiota changes (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth among many others).

In mechanism, TMAO enhances platelet hyperreactivity by altering Ca2+ signaling and elicits a pro-thrombotic effect. Especially, TMAO seems to induce systemic inflammation that contributes to CAD progression. This is particularly relevant given that TMAO directly activates inflammatory pathways, and elicits perturbations in membrane dynamics in human aortic ECs and smooth muscle cells.

"The gut microbiome is crucially engaged in the regulation and maintenance of human health and homeostasis, i.e., proper intestine motion, fibre digestion, regulating the development of host immunity, and exerting a protective effect against pathogenic factors (such as Campylobacter jejuni, Helicobacter pylori, and Clostridium difficile). The Irish ELDERMET study (Elderly to benefit from Research Project) demonstrated the correlation between intestinal microbiota diversity and health outcomes such as overall health, frailty, and proper immune functions, underlying the gut microbiota composition as a possible indicator of healthy ageing. Multiple studies showed the interplay between the intestinal microbiota and modulation of central nervous system (CNS) functions and neurodegeneration processes, pointing to the microbiome-gut-brain axis as one of the factors modulating host homeostasis in health and disease. In the past decade, the alterations of the gut microbiota, which are called dysbiosis, have been connected with the pathophysiology of numerous common diseases such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, gastrointestinal diseases, and cardiovascular events. Dysbiosis state is also implicated in neurological and neurodegenerative disorders such as autism, and Alzheimer's (AD) or Parkinson's (PD) diseases.

"The mechanism by which BCAAs induce insulin resistance is still not fully understood. The rise of BCAA levels is found to regulate glycolipid metabolism, cause insulin resistance, and increase the risk of T2D. Other animal experiments have shown that elevated BCAAs are transferred to skeletal muscle, and are interfered with lipid metabolism, which causes the accumulation of lipid metabolites and ultimately leads to skeletal muscle insulin resistance. Additionally, BCAAs are the key regulatory factor of mTORC1. It activates mTORC1 and ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (S6K1) by inducing the phosphorylation of IRS1, blocking the insulin signaling pathway, and eventually causing insulin resistance. However, 2 other studies have shown that BCAAs may exert their functions without mTORC1. One study reported that the metabolites of BCAAs, 3-hydroxy isobutyrate, could cause insulin resistance by promoting skeletal muscle sprouting.

"Recently, bacterial strains producing SCFAs have gained extreme popularity. SCFAs are small organic monocarboxylic acids, released after the fermentation of indigestible alimentary fiber (mainly galacto- or fructooligosaccharides), plant-derived polysaccharides, or the metabolism of amino acids, and are considered a key gut-derived metabolites with beneficial health effects and as essential in gut-brain crosstalk. The type of formed SCFAs is correlated with the kind of fiber ingested and the overall gut microbiota population. For example, microbes belonging to Firmicutes phyla (e.g., Lachnospiraceae, Eubacterium, or Roseburia belonging to the Clostridia class) are responsible for the main production of butyrate, whereas Bifidobacteria spp. produce lactate and acetate. SCFAs are significantly reduced during dysbiosis, where disrupted gut epithelial integrity, inflammation, and altered microbiome metabolic processes occur. In a healthy colon, levels of SCFAs can vary depending on a diet; however, in multiple diseases, these levels are altered. SCFAs may also act in an indirect or direct way through G-protein-coupled receptors or as histone deacetylase epigenetic modulators. They participate in various physiological processes, such as cell energetics and colonocyte metabolism and skeletal, adipose, and liver tissue modulation. Their major functions comprise the activation of trophic factors, energy management, and the manufacturing of regulatory T-cells.

"Aromatic amino acids including tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine are metabolized into indole and phenols by certain intestinal anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, and Peptostreptococcus. Tryptophan is decomposed into indole, indoleacetic acid, indole-3-lactic acid, 3-methylindole (skatole) and other indole compounds under the action of tryptophanase. Tryptophanase is the key enzyme that generates indole. The activity of the enzyme is easily induced by the substrate tryptophan, so when the amount of tryptophan changes in the colonic environment, the content of indole will fluctuate greatly. Of note, the metabolic products of aromatic amino acids generated by gut microbiota have a great impact on the pathology of cardiometabolic diseases. For example, indole propionic acid is associated with insulin sensitivity and appears to reduce the risk of diabetes. Moreover, the gut microbiota metabolizes dietary tryptophan to indoxyl, which further generates indoxyl sulfate through sulfonation. Excessive accumulation of indoxyl sulfate causes cardiomyocyte damage and increases thrombus formation. Another phenol compound, 4-methylphenol, can inhibit the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into mature adipocytes, induce apoptosis and reduce glucose uptake.

"The gut leakage promotes the formation of coronary heart diseases and heart failure (created with BioRender.com). Dysbiosis of gut microbiota triggers gut leakage, which increases microbiota translocation, resulting in inflammation and abnormal metabolism. The gut microbiota, as a metabolic filter, also converts nutrients to (microbial-associated) metabolites, including BAs, TMAO, SCFAs, and so on, which affect the progression of coronary heart diseases and heart failure. For instance, SCFAs play a protective role by inhibiting the inflammatory response and improving angiogenesis.

"The PD microbiome has a diminished variety of bacterial taxonomic groups, especially the ones associated with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects and the increase of phyla, which has toxic effects. Predominantly, the reduction was observed in the Lachnospiraceae family, including Butyrivibrio, Pseudobutyrivibrio, Coprococcus, Blautia and SCFAs-producing Prevotellaceae. The increased amount of Enterobacteriaceae is linked to the severity of postural instability and walking difficulties. Moreover, the PD microbiome is characterised by increased Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium species and decreased amount of Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae. The overgrowth of Akkermansia spp. in PD patients may be strain-specific and can be related to immune-response alterations, decreased mucus thicknesses, and increased constipation. Faecalibacterium family is a crucial player producing SCFAs and anti-inflammatory metabolites, maintaining gut health. Faecalibacterium balance disturbances can lead to impaired gut-barrier function, increasing the risk of infection with enteric pathogens and boosting alpha-synuclein formation. Similarly, the Lachnospiraceae family can produce butyrate, important for the proper function of the gut epithelium. Decreased Lachnospiraceae quantity might aggravate gut inflammation, stimulate toxin production, and damage the integrity of the gut epithelial barrier. PD patients' intestinal microflora were characterised by a diminished abundance of Lachnospiraceae, which was positively correlated with PD progress, cognitive decline, and impaired motor functions. These microbiome's compositional changes correlate well with some metabolic switches. PD microbiota show reduced SCFAs production, decreased carbohydrate fermentation, and augmented proteolytic fermentation. Chen et al. demonstrated that the SCFA level was relevant to microbiota composition changes and the clinical severity of PD. The levels of SCFAs acetate, butyrate, and propionate in fecal samples of PD patients were significantly reduced, contrary to their elevated concentration in plasma. Rodent models of PD disease have shown a positive effect of SCFAs on behavior and PD symptoms. Butyrate, as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, exerts neuroprotective activity, reducing dopaminergic cell death, and motor impairment, and improving cognitive functions. Taken together, SCFAs play an important role in protection from PD disease and could be proposed as representative gut-oriented indicators for diversifying individuals with PD and placing disease progression.",16553034.0,HIbG6Q3d9d,NILreqrbNN,Lachnospiraceae,1265.0,1280.0,Species,1384.0,1406.0,gut epithelial barrier,Cellline,worsen,Species$Cellline,"['affects', 'worsen', 'Location_of', 'Interacts_with', 'None', 'improve', 'start', 'increase', 'Associated_with', 'part_of']"

Preclinical tests on genetically modified mice with PD demonstrated the correlation between Akkermansia muciniphila and Bilophila wadsworthia abundance and decreased the mice motor activity. Furthermore, Akkermansia muciniphila produces high amounts of pro-inflammatory hydrogen sulphide, correlated with PD pathology and being a neurotoxin affecting brain mitochondrial energy homeostasis through the inhibition of brain glutathione concentration.

Oppositely, other studies suggested that patients with obesity had higher levels of SCFAs in their intestine and feces than healthy participants.

"In summary, the gut microbiota generates a series of bioactive metabolites to interact with host metabolism. These metabolites mainly include SCFAs, primary and secondary BAs, TMAO, and so on. Among these metabolites, some exert synergistic effects to promote host health by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system to control glucose metabolism. For example, SCFAs interact with human hormones such as GLP-1 and PYY to effect energy uptake and the development of obesity. SCFAs are beneficial for regulating appetite and energy intake, and preventing the formation of atherosclerosis. Other metabolites, such as TMAO and phenylacetylglutamine (PAGln), may be toxic. For example, TMAO may be proatherogenic to promote the process of thrombosis and atherosclerosis, thereby increasing the risk of cardiovascular events. Patients with CVDs had lower levels of SCFA generation and higher levels of TMAO production due to the change in gut microbiota. Furthermore, TMAO causes vascular endothelial damage and promotes the production of atherosclerotic plaques. TMAO can also increase the release of intracellular calcium ions, enhance the reactivity of platelets, and increase the risk of thrombosis to increase CVDs susceptibility. Besides, PAGln enhances platelet reactivity and thrombosis, leading to CVDs. Taken together, mounting evidence suggests that changes in gut microbiota metabolites are part of the crucial mechanisms by which the gut microbiota regulates the occurrence and development of CVDs.",18055127.0,1167,x6kPS5prmv,thrombosis,1191.0,1201.0,Disease,479.0,484.0,SCFAs,Chemical,None,Disease$Chemical,"['decrease', 'affects', 'increase', 'start', 'None', 'Associated_with', 'Location_of', 'possible', 'stop']"

"Besides the propagation of an inflammatory state, microbial endotoxins are probably involved in AD's inflammatory amyloidosis. Metagenomics analysis showed that patients suffering from cognitive dysfunctions related to amyloidosis demonstrated elevated amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neurotoxic compounds. In these patients, increased inflammation was probably related to Eubacterium deficiency, and an overabundance of gram-negative Escherichia and Shigella species, which are known amyloid producers. They manufacture ""curli"" amyloid fibers, accumulated extracellularly through an elaborated system. Further studies revealed that the overproduction of Abeta plaques is correlated with excessive growth of Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycobacterium and Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus spp.. Galloway et al. found Abeta in small intestine epithelial cells, suggesting that gut-derived amyloids could be absorbed and finally reach systemic circulation, where they can act as pro-inflammatory factors and trigger fibrillogenesis.

In patients with diabetes, changes in gut microbiota composition may alter the ratio of primary BAs to secondary BAs.

"The gut microbiota is critical to human health, such as digesting nutrients, forming the intestinal epithelial barrier, regulating immune function, producing vitamins and hormones, and producing metabolites to interact with the host. Meanwhile, increasing evidence indicates that the gut microbiota has a strong correlation with the occurrence, progression and treatment of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). In patients with CVDs and corresponding risk factors, the composition and ratio of gut microbiota have significant differences compared with their healthy counterparts. Therefore, gut microbiota dysbiosis, gut microbiota-generated metabolites, and the related signaling pathway may serve as explanations for some of the mechanisms about the occurrence and development of CVDs. Several studies have also demonstrated that many traditional and latest therapeutic treatments of CVDs are associated with the gut microbiota and its generated metabolites and related signaling pathways. Given that information, we summarized the latest advances in the current research regarding the effect of gut microbiota on health, the main cardiovascular risk factors, and CVDs, highlighted the roles and mechanisms of several metabolites, and introduced corresponding promising treatments for CVDs regarding the gut microbiota.

"The mechanism by which BCAAs induce insulin resistance is still not fully understood. The rise of BCAA levels is found to regulate glycolipid metabolism, cause insulin resistance, and increase the risk of T2D. Other animal experiments have shown that elevated BCAAs are transferred to skeletal muscle, and are interfered with lipid metabolism, which causes the accumulation of lipid metabolites and ultimately leads to skeletal muscle insulin resistance. Additionally, BCAAs are the key regulatory factor of mTORC1. It activates mTORC1 and ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (S6K1) by inducing the phosphorylation of IRS1, blocking the insulin signaling pathway, and eventually causing insulin resistance. However, 2 other studies have shown that BCAAs may exert their functions without mTORC1. One study reported that the metabolites of BCAAs, 3-hydroxy isobutyrate, could cause insulin resistance by promoting skeletal muscle sprouting.

Plasma TMAO levels are associated with long-term risks of cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndrome, at least in particular related to its pro-inflammatory capacity, promoting the adhesion ability of aortic endothelial cells. In mechanism, TMAO enhances platelet hyperreactivity by altering Ca2+ signaling and elicits a pro-thrombotic effect. Especially, TMAO seems to induce systemic inflammation that contributes to CAD progression. This is particularly relevant given that TMAO directly activates inflammatory pathways, and elicits perturbations in membrane dynamics in human aortic ECs and smooth muscle cells.

"The health of the gut microbiome can vary depending on various factors including diet (e.g., ingestion of saturated/unsaturated dietary fats, vitamins, minerals, dairy products, alcoholic beverages, polyphenols containing food such as cocoa-rich chocolate, tea, or coffee), dietary patterns, geographical area, and diet-related habits (sometimes varying between males and females) and sex (the influence of sex hormones). A positive correlation between polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (N-3 PUFA), and alpha-linolenic acid (aLNA) ingestion and protection against PD development in dose-response trends was demonstrated. American studies demonstrated that PUFA replacement with increased animal fat intake (Western Diet) significantly increased the risk of PD in males only. Excessive animal fat intake can promote dysbiosis and the production of harmful microbial metabolites, which can increase the prevalence of the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, sex differences are implicated in the mental health and prevalence of psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, and neurodegenerative disorders. It has been demonstrated that PD patients usually have altered microbiome compositions compared with controls. Similar to AD, many sex differences in PD are correlated with the protective nature of estrogens, as they are impacted by the gut-brain axis and protect against oxidative damage, thereby supporting dopaminergic function. It has been demonstrated that at age 45, the estimated overall lifetime risk for AD is about 20% for females and 10% for males, which is followed by a disruption in the patient's gut microbiota composition.

Furthermore, the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota triggers intestinal mucosal barrier damage, leading to inflammation and disordered nutrient metabolism.

"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal health condition caused by the progressive neural death of the spinal cord, brain stem, and motor cortex neurons, causing advanced weakness, paralysis, eating difficulties, and respiratory failure. One of the main signs of ALS is the accumulation of phosphorylated protein, which binds to DNA in the form of protein aggregates deposited in glia and motor neurons. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) methods, such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing, have demonstrated the alteration of numerous bacteria, including Parabacteroides distasonis, Lactobacillus gasseri, Prevotella melaninogenica, Ruminococcus torques, and Akkermansia muciniphila. Changes in bacterial abundance and diversity correlate with ASL origins (as one of the environmental factors) together with impaired metabolism, immunological functions, and toxin accumulation, leading to brain damage.

"The origins of Parkinson's disease are the result of many factors such as increased age, polygenic factors (disease-segregating mutations in alpha-synuclein protein occurring in 15% of PD patients), toxins, and infectious agents. In 2006, Braak et al. assumed the gut-related origins of Parkinson's disease. One of the key pathological hallmarks of PD is Lewy bodies, being eosinophilic inclusion forms of misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates. Importantly, alpha-synuclein protein has a tendency to misfold and form aggregates. Its accumulation has been detected during bacterial and viral infections in the gut. Moreover, it can be recognized as a characteristic indicator of PD neural degeneration. This protein aggregate can boost the local immune response. Interestingly, alpha-synuclein deposition has been confirmed in the neurons of the intestinal submucosa, together with a possibility of the alpha-synuclein transport to the brain via the vagus nerve (translocation of prion-like proteins). Misfolded alpha-synuclein triggers neuronal dysfunction and progressive degeneration, thereby enabling disease progression.

It is predicted that more than 50% of the neurobiology in autism disorders may be determined by non-genetic factors, such as environmental factors, parental age, and preterm birth, among many others. Autism is not only associated with disorders of a neurological nature, but also with disturbances in the qualitative and quantitative arrangement of the gut microbiota, intestinal immune inflammation, and dysbiosis, as confirmed in many studies, and correlated with disease severity.

"Multiple sclerosis is a chronic neurodegenerative autoimmune disorder, where the human immune system attacks the myelin sheath surrounding axon terminals, thereby triggering long-lasting inflammation within the CNS, abrasion formation, and demyelination of axons. Besides, afterward, it can cause autonomic and cognitive problems, motor, sensory, and visual flaws, and finally paralysis and disruption of the BBB. Various animal and human studies suggested the participation of gut microbiota in the development of MS. Animal studies on an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mice model revealed a significant reduction in Lactobacillus phyla, contributing to an impairment of the mice's immune systems. In patients diagnosed with MS, a reduction in the variety and quantity of gut bacteria was detected, confirming a moderate dysbiosis state.

"Another important mechanism of gut microbiota related to diabetes is the modulation of BCAAs. Evidence indicates that gut microbiota can change the decomposition of protein as well as the level of BCAAs in plasma. BCAAs and their metabolites are the most significant factors distinguishing normal from abnormal metabolism. Plasma BCAAs levels of T2D patients are higher than those with normal blood glucose, and BCAAs levels are positively correlated with the homeostasis model-assessed insulin resistance index.

"The function of the gut microbiota is closely related to the risk of CVDs. Specifically, an impaired mucosal barrier, overactivated inflammation, and immune dysfunction are crucial steps in the development of CVDs triggered by gut microbiota dysbiosis. The structural constituents of gram-negative bacteria, such as LPS, are the main reason for endotoxemia and impaired intestinal mucosal barrier function. It has been reported that LPS is important in the development of cardiometabolic diseases. Moreover, studies showed that the high-fat diet could result in decreased intestinal levels of gram-positive Bifidobacteria and increased LPS-containing gut microbiota which further leads to obesity, the main risk factor for CVDs. Importantly, continuous subcutaneous infusion of LPS showed a tendency to cause the change of glucose metabolism and the pattern of weight gain was similar to that seen when taking a high-fat diet. Therefore, intestinal dysbiosis and the corresponding change in metabolites lead to abnormal nutrient metabolism, insulin resistance, and increased adipose tissue storage, which increases the risk of cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity and diabetes. Herein, we take obesity and diabetes as examples to explain the effect of gut microbiota on cardiovascular risk factors (Fig. 3).",18057704.0,1306,5eO7H-Hnx7,intestinal dysbiosis,938.0,958.0,Disease,1065.0,1089.0,increased adipose tissue,Disease,causes,Disease$Disease,"['None', 'possible', 'part_of', 'causes', 'Associated_with', 'Marker/Mechanism', 'affects', 'reveals', 'increase', 'worsen', 'presence', 'complicates']"
"The mechanism by which BCAAs induce insulin resistance is still not fully understood. The rise of BCAA levels is found to regulate glycolipid metabolism, cause insulin resistance, and increase the risk of T2D. Other animal experiments have shown that elevated BCAAs are transferred to skeletal muscle, and are interfered with lipid metabolism, which causes the accumulation of lipid metabolites and ultimately leads to skeletal muscle insulin resistance. Additionally, BCAAs are the key regulatory factor of mTORC1. It activates mTORC1 and ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (S6K1) by inducing the phosphorylation of IRS1, blocking the insulin signaling pathway, and eventually causing insulin resistance. However, 2 other studies have shown that BCAAs may exert their functions without mTORC1. One study reported that the metabolites of BCAAs, 3-hydroxy isobutyrate, could cause insulin resistance by promoting skeletal muscle sprouting. Another study reported that a diet rich in BCAAs can cause overeating, obesity, and shortened lifespan, which was not related to the mTOR signaling pathway in the liver but is mainly due to hyperphagia.",18449544.0,g-T8lRWP1j,gXjKMzB8jA,mTORC1,529.0,535.0,Species,1072.0,1077.0,mTOR ,Species,None,Species$Species,"['None', 'part_of', 'increase', 'experiences', 'affects', 'Associated_with', 'start', 'improve', 'Location_of', 'presence', 'possible', 'decrease', 'worsen', 'Interacts_with', 'treats']"

"Recently, bacterial strains producing SCFAs have gained extreme popularity. SCFAs are small organic monocarboxylic acids, released after the fermentation of indigestible alimentary fiber (mainly galacto- or fructooligosaccharides), plant-derived polysaccharides, or the metabolism of amino acids, and are considered a key gut-derived metabolites with beneficial health effects and as essential in gut-brain crosstalk. The type of formed SCFAs is correlated with the kind of fiber ingested and the overall gut microbiota population. For example, microbes belonging to Firmicutes phyla (e.g., Lachnospiraceae, Eubacterium, or Roseburia belonging to the Clostridia class) are responsible for the main production of butyrate, whereas Bifidobacteria spp. produce lactate and acetate. SCFAs are significantly reduced during dysbiosis, where disrupted gut epithelial integrity, inflammation, and altered microbiome metabolic processes occur. In a healthy colon, levels of SCFAs can vary depending on a diet; however, in multiple diseases, these levels are altered. SCFAs may also act in an indirect or direct way through G-protein-coupled receptors or as histone deacetylase epigenetic modulators. They participate in various physiological processes, such as cell energetics and colonocyte metabolism and skeletal, adipose, and liver tissue modulation. Their major functions comprise the activation of trophic factors, energy management, and the manufacturing of regulatory T-cells.

"In the past decade, single dietary factors which can positively manipulate the gut microbiota-brain axis through microbiome modulation have gained significant attention. One of these factors is probiotic bacteria and/or prebiotics. Probiotics are defined as microbial organisms with a beneficial role in the host's health and homeostasis, which help to preserve digestive, metabolic, immune, and neuroendocrine functions. Naturally probiotic bacteria can be found in fermented food. Experimental results revealed that the administration of probiotics alone or in combination with prebiotics (fructooligosaccharides or galactooligosaccharides) improved the gastrointestinal barrier, which is the first line of ""defence"" from harmful factors occurring in food, and the microbiome. Probiotics and prebiotics are well-documented ""problem-solution"" for gastrointestinal diseases. Moreover, probiotics can reduce CNS inflammatory processes and activation of microglia, demonstrating promising potential for use in neurodegenerative diseases as ingestible ""psychobiotics"". Many studies indicate that the ingestion of probiotics can serve as a microbiological strategy against neurodegenerative diseases such as AD; however, the exact mechanism is under investigation. Experiments performed on mice underline the hypothesis that mechanisms related to neuroprotective effects of Bifidobacterium breve administration may be connected with neuroinflammation and cognition pathways, probably through the production of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) neurotransmitter and the regulation of the gut microbial composition. Clinical results of a randomized double-blind controlled trial revealed that 3-month exposure to Lactobacillus spp. And a Bifidobacterium bifidum ""cocktail"" enhanced cognitive functions and memory, as examined in a mini-mental state test. It was demonstrated that Bifidobacterium breve exerts positive and unique activity in AD patients, improving cognitive functions and reducing neuroinflammation.

"SCFAs may prevent obesity by regulating the homeostasis of glucose and lipid metabolism. For instance, acetate decreases appetite and nutrient intake. Propionate activates intestinal gluconeogenesis by a gut-brain neural circuit to promote energy balance. Butyrate provides energy for colon cells, maintains the integrity of intestinal walls, and improves the insulin response, which activates gluconeogenesis to maintain the balance of glucose and energy through the cAMP pathway. And one study indicated that oral butyrate intake prevents obesity and insulin resistance. Furthermore, the role of SCFAs in metabolic hemostasis is related to other factors. Adenosine monophosphate activating protein (AMPK) is a heterotrimeric enzyme that stimulates liver and muscle fatty acid oxidation pathways. SCFAs promote the activity of AMPK and improve its ability to oxidize fatty acids. Last, SCFAs can affect the development of dyslipidemia. SCFAs increase the expression of fasting-induced adipose factor (FIAF), a circulating lipoprotein lipase inhibitor, by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-gamma), thereby decreasing the activity of lipoproteinases and inhibiting lipolysis in adipose tissues.

"The origins of Parkinson's disease are the result of many factors such as increased age, polygenic factors (disease-segregating mutations in alpha-synuclein protein occurring in 15% of PD patients), toxins, and infectious agents. In 2006, Braak et al. assumed the gut-related origins of Parkinson's disease. One of the key pathological hallmarks of PD is Lewy bodies, being eosinophilic inclusion forms of misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates. Importantly, alpha-synuclein protein has a tendency to misfold and form aggregates. Its accumulation has been detected during bacterial and viral infections in the gut. Moreover, it can be recognized as a characteristic indicator of PD neural degeneration. This protein aggregate can boost the local immune response. Interestingly, alpha-synuclein deposition has been confirmed in the neurons of the intestinal submucosa, together with a possibility of the alpha-synuclein transport to the brain via the vagus nerve (translocation of prion-like proteins). Misfolded alpha-synuclein triggers neuronal dysfunction and progressive degeneration, thereby enabling disease progression. Additionally, alpha-synuclein deposition in CNS is associated with intestinal hyperpermeability, TLRs, and pro-inflammatory cytokine overexpression.

"The origins of Parkinson's disease are the result of many factors such as increased age, polygenic factors (disease-segregating mutations in alpha-synuclein protein occurring in 15% of PD patients), toxins, and infectious agents. In 2006, Braak et al. assumed the gut-related origins of Parkinson's disease. One of the key pathological hallmarks of PD is Lewy bodies, being eosinophilic inclusion forms of misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates. Importantly, alpha-synuclein protein has a tendency to misfold and form aggregates. Its accumulation has been detected during bacterial and viral infections in the gut. Moreover, it can be recognized as a characteristic indicator of PD neural degeneration. This protein aggregate can boost the local immune response. Interestingly, alpha-synuclein deposition has been confirmed in the neurons of the intestinal submucosa, together with a possibility of the alpha-synuclein transport to the brain via the vagus nerve (translocation of prion-like proteins). Misfolded alpha-synuclein triggers neuronal dysfunction and progressive degeneration, thereby enabling disease progression.

"Atherosclerosis is the pathological basis of various CVDs, and seriously harms human health. The pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is based on the accumulation of lipids in the intima of the most frequently involved arteries, leading to the proliferation of fibers and calcium deposition, gradually thickening and hardening the walls of blood vessels. This process is closely associated with the inflammatory response. Of note, there is a serious dysbiosis between the composition of gut microbiota and interspecific relationships in individuals with atherosclerosis.

"BAs, as by-products of cholesterol metabolism, are the main organic component of bile and are synthesized in hepatocytes. Cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) are primary BAs directly synthesized from cholesterol; secondary BAs include deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholic acid (LCA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and their glycine and taurine conjugated forms. BAs are excreted into the intestine to aid in the digestion and absorption of lipids and combine with farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and takeda-G-protein receptor 5 (TGR5) (Fig. 2). There is a strong biochemical relationship between BAs and gut microbiota. Some gut microbiota in healthy people can convert conjugated BAs into free BAs, and can transform BAs into secondary BAs with the help of bile salt hydrolase (BSH) and cholesterol 7-alpha hydroxy-lase (CYP7A1), so as to reduce blood cholesterol by affecting the enterohepatic circulation of BAs. Besides, the gut microbiota affects the metabolism of BAs by regulating the activity of BSH to reduce LDL cholesterol levels. BAs have bacteriostatic properties and an antimicrobial effect. BAs destroy the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane and thereby change the intestinal microecology. BAs also prevent bacteria from overgrowth and decrease inflammation. More importantly, BAs are also closely associated with CVDs. For example, BAs levels in the feces of patients with CVDs are different from those in healthy individuals.

"At the end of this chapter, it is worth mentioning the fact that the interaction between the microbiome and the host is bidirectional, and some metabolic changes, which could be a pathological result of disease progression, also influence microbiome metabolism. A good example is a disturbance in cholesterol homeostasis, which correlates with an augmented probability of Alzheimer's disease occurrence. In addition, alteration of the intestinal microbiota composition with the subsequent fluctuations in the serum and brain levels of bile acids (BAs) is involved in the development of AD. BAs can act as detergents, affecting BBB permeability, and incrementing brain influx of peripheral cholesterol and BAs. Therefore, proper cholesterol elimination pathways play a crucial role in AD prevention and treatment. The gut microbiome is a main ""organ"" metabolizing secondary bile acids. Peripheral cholesterol is eliminated mainly through its liver conversion to BAs. The gut microbiota performs BA transformation via deconjugation and dehydroxylation, leading to secondary BA formation. Nho et al. investigated the correlation between neurodegeneration and BAs, B-amyloid, and tau protein concentration. The application of targeted metabolomics enabled the determination of the association between intestinal microbiota-derived secondary bile acids and sera BAs. Interestingly, the analysis indicated an imbalanced BA ratio, underlying an increased amount of secondary BAs over primary ones. Another clinical study confirmed the correlation between bile acid metabolic profile and the prevalence of AD and mild cognitive impairment, showing similar BA ratio disruptions. Decreased cognitive functions were positively associated with increased concentrations of secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid, and glycolithocholic acid. The described results suggested the involvement of the pathological gut microbiota in AD development; however, still it requires more in-depth studies.",16559364.0,4Yr9CZnqor,KP7cKfZPwv,liver,941.0,946.0,Cellline,961.0,964.0,BAs,Chemical,start,Cellline$Chemical,"['Location_of', 'Interacts_with', 'affects', 'None', 'start']"

"In summary, the gut microbiota generates a series of bioactive metabolites to interact with host metabolism. These metabolites mainly include SCFAs, primary and secondary BAs, TMAO, and so on. Among these metabolites, some exert synergistic effects to promote host health by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system to control glucose metabolism. For example, SCFAs interact with human hormones such as GLP-1 and PYY to effect energy uptake and the development of obesity. SCFAs are beneficial for regulating appetite and energy intake, and preventing the formation of atherosclerosis. Other metabolites, such as TMAO and phenylacetylglutamine (PAGln), may be toxic. For example, TMAO may be proatherogenic to promote the process of thrombosis and atherosclerosis, thereby increasing the risk of cardiovascular events. Patients with CVDs had lower levels of SCFA generation and higher levels of TMAO production due to the change in gut microbiota. Furthermore, TMAO causes vascular endothelial damage and promotes the production of atherosclerotic plaques. TMAO can also increase the release of intracellular calcium ions, enhance the reactivity of platelets, and increase the risk of thrombosis to increase CVDs susceptibility. Besides, PAGln enhances platelet reactivity and thrombosis, leading to CVDs. Taken together, mounting evidence suggests that changes in gut microbiota metabolites are part of the crucial mechanisms by which the gut microbiota regulates the occurrence and development of CVDs.",18055127.0,1164,1153,CVDs,839.0,843.0,Disease,864.0,868.0,SCFA,Chemical,decrease,Disease$Chemical,"['decrease', 'affects', 'increase', 'start', 'None', 'Associated_with', 'Location_of', 'possible', 'stop']"

"Experimental research confirms the hypothesis regarding SCFA reduction in autoimmune diseases (MS among others) and altered gut microbiota. A low level of SCFAs dysregulates Treg cell functions, leading to insufficient immune tolerance towards endogenous components and enteric microbiota. However, this process can be reversed by SCFAs supplementation (e.g., propionic acid). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing NFkappaB activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation and on microglial cells in vitro. TUDCA binds to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) expressed in microglial cells. This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS). Experimental results demonstrated that TUDCA acted as a double-edged sword, triggering microglia enhancement in anti-inflammatory and alternatively activated markers and on the other hand reducing the infiltration of macrophages and microglia with expressed pro-inflammatory markers. Interestingly, during neuroinflammation, microglial cells change their morphology, converting themselves into reactive macrophage-like forms. However, microglial cells are flexible, as they can sometimes polarize towards alternatively activated phenotypes, promoting CNS pathologies (proinflammatory or M1 microglia), or exert anti-inflammatory effects, boosting cell repair and remodeling. Bile acids were identified as nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor agonists, leading to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) depletion (in a mouse model) and neuroinflammatory process adjustment. The administration of the complex probiotic positively influenced the intestinal flora balance in patients diagnosed with MS. The probiotic prevented the onset of dysbiosis, significantly increasing the amount of Methanobrevibacter and Akkermansia, Prevotella, and Sutterella in MS patients, influencing gene expression and the production of beneficial bacterial metabolites.",16224291.0,1280,IR7wlpzCQQ,tauroursodeoxycholic acid,739.0,764.0,Chemical,941.0,958.0,neuroinflammation,Disease,prevents,Chemical$Disease,"['improve', 'increase', 'Associated_with', 'affects', 'None', 'treats', 'Marker/Mechanism', 'causes', 'prevents', 'Negative_correlation', 'possible', 'complicates', 'decrease', 'reveals', 'worsen', 'Interacts_with']"

They are indispensable for maintaining the physiological function of adult tissues and organs by synthesizing a variety of vitamins, participating in food digestion, producing lactic acid, promoting intestinal peristalsis, inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microbiota, and activating the immune system.

"Recently, bacterial strains producing SCFAs have gained extreme popularity. SCFAs are small organic monocarboxylic acids, released after the fermentation of indigestible alimentary fiber (mainly galacto- or fructooligosaccharides), plant-derived polysaccharides, or the metabolism of amino acids, and are considered a key gut-derived metabolites with beneficial health effects and as essential in gut-brain crosstalk. The type of formed SCFAs is correlated with the kind of fiber ingested and the overall gut microbiota population. For example, microbes belonging to Firmicutes phyla (e.g., Lachnospiraceae, Eubacterium, or Roseburia belonging to the Clostridia class) are responsible for the main production of butyrate, whereas Bifidobacteria spp. produce lactate and acetate. SCFAs are significantly reduced during dysbiosis, where disrupted gut epithelial integrity, inflammation, and altered microbiome metabolic processes occur. In a healthy colon, levels of SCFAs can vary depending on a diet; however, in multiple diseases, these levels are altered. SCFAs may also act in an indirect or direct way through G-protein-coupled receptors or as histone deacetylase epigenetic modulators. They participate in various physiological processes, such as cell energetics and colonocyte metabolism and skeletal, adipose, and liver tissue modulation. Their major functions comprise the activation of trophic factors, energy management, and the manufacturing of regulatory T-cells.

"BAs are steroid carboxylic acids mainly derived from cholesterol through the action of CYP7A1, and their main function is to digest and absorb lipids and fat-soluble vitamins in the small intestine. The gut microbiota can also affect health by modulating the metabolic levels of total BAs, DCA and LCA, either by metabolizing bile salts or modulating downstream signaling pathways of BAs. Most gut microbiota have BSH activity. For example, Firmicutes have CYP7A1, which most intestinal microorganisms do not have. Bacteroides can oxidize, epimerize and esterify BAs at the same time.",18121247.0,3yLmVeQryb,G-6mDhMxE4,BAs,0.0,3.0,Chemical,8.0,32.0,steroid carboxylic acids,Chemical,part_of,Chemical$Chemical,"['affects', 'Associated_with', 'part_of', 'None', 'improve', 'Physically_related_to', 'possible', 'start', 'increase', 'decrease', 'Location_of', 'Interacts_with', 'prevents', 'worsen']"
"Another important mechanism of gut microbiota related to diabetes is the modulation of BCAAs. Evidence indicates that gut microbiota can change the decomposition of protein as well as the level of BCAAs in plasma. BCAAs and their metabolites are the most significant factors distinguishing normal from abnormal metabolism. Plasma BCAAs levels of T2D patients are higher than those with normal blood glucose, and BCAAs levels are positively correlated with the homeostasis model-assessed insulin resistance index. Studies have suggested that elevated blood BCAAs concentrations are associated with an increased risk of T2D and insulin-resistance, and elevated BCAAs caused by dysmetabolism are important risk factors for T2D. Additionally, BCAAs also serve as biomarkers that monitor the treatment effect of T2D.",18395401.0,2225,Dw8GXQ6eWo,patients,350.0,358.0,Species,346.0,349.0,T2D,Disease,experiences,Species$Disease,"['Negative_correlation', 'prevents', 'experiences', 'possible', 'causes', 'Associated_with', 'decrease', 'None', 'improve', 'Marker/Mechanism', 'increase', 'affects', 'treats', 'start', 'complicates', 'Interacts_with']"
"The origins of Parkinson's disease are the result of many factors such as increased age, polygenic factors (disease-segregating mutations in alpha-synuclein protein occurring in 15% of PD patients), toxins, and infectious agents. In 2006, Braak et al. assumed the gut-related origins of Parkinson's disease. One of the key pathological hallmarks of PD is Lewy bodies, being eosinophilic inclusion forms of misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates. Importantly, alpha-synuclein protein has a tendency to misfold and form aggregates. Its accumulation has been detected during bacterial and viral infections in the gut. Moreover, it can be recognized as a characteristic indicator of PD neural degeneration. This protein aggregate can boost the local immune response. Interestingly, alpha-synuclein deposition has been confirmed in the neurons of the intestinal submucosa, together with a possibility of the alpha-synuclein transport to the brain via the vagus nerve (translocation of prion-like proteins). Misfolded alpha-synuclein triggers neuronal dysfunction and progressive degeneration, thereby enabling disease progression. Additionally, alpha-synuclein deposition in CNS is associated with intestinal hyperpermeability, TLRs, and pro-inflammatory cytokine overexpression.

"SCFAs are metabolites of dietary fibers and resistant starch fermented by gut microbes. The SCFA-producing microbiota are important for cardiovascular health.

"Alzheimer's disease (AD), commonly known as senile dementia, is a chronic, devastating, neurodegenerative, and neuroinflammatory disorder with rising incidence and is considered to be the most frequent form of dementia in aging individuals (caused by aberrant protein processing, trafficking, and aggregation in neural cells). The World Alzheimer Report indicates that 50 million people suffer from AD-related neurological problems and this number will increase to 152 million in 2050. It is predicted that in 2030 up to 66 million people will suffer from AD. AD is a multifactorial disease characterized by synapse loss, extracellular cerebral accumulation of insoluble peptides belonging to amyloid-beta (Abeta), the aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein inside the cells, neurofibrillary mass formation, neuronal death (in the neocortex and hippocampus), progressive memory deterioration, and cognition decline leading to dementia. AD is associated with more than 700 genetic and environmental risk factors. From the genetic point of view, one of the most important risk factors related to AD development is the incidence of a ""4 allele variant in the apolipoprotein"" (APOE4) gene, which is associated with cholesterol transport in CNS, and also contributes to metabolomic and taxonomic changes in the microbiome.",16422307.0,A4JYqgpHe4,382,synapse loss,608.0,620.0,Disease,560.0,562.0,AD,Disease,Marker/Mechanism,Disease$Disease,"['None', 'possible', 'part_of', 'causes', 'Associated_with', 'Marker/Mechanism', 'affects', 'reveals', 'increase', 'worsen', 'presence', 'complicates']"
"The analysis of the intestinal microbiome of adolescent and adult ADHD patients (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) indicated changes and imbalances in the gut microbiota followed by elevated levels of Bifidobacterium and Eggerthella genera related to boosted dopamine precursor formation and connected with ADHD development. Some reports indicated the implication of the microbiome in the regulation of brain dopamine levels. The Bifidobacterium genus plays an important role in dopamine precursor production (cyclohexadienyl dehydratase) in ADHD patients. Jiang et al. reported a reduction of Faecalibacterium spp. in paediatric patients diagnosed with ADHD and they suggested Faecalibacterium as a new marker of ADHD. Faecalibacterium depletion was followed by increased cytokine levels and inflammation. Interestingly, three bacterial species (Bacteroides uniformis, Bacteroides ovatus, and Sutterella stercoricanis) were identified as potential biomarkers of ADHD. Tengeler et al. reported increased anxiety in a GF mice model with human microbiota transplanted from ADHD-suffering individuals. Another clinical trial performed on infants indicated the beneficial and protective effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG administration in the prevention of ADHD development. Moreover, L. rhamnosus probiotic administration reduced the quantity of the following proinflammatory factors: IL-12 p70, IL-10, TNF-alpha, and IL-6.",16213267.0,1596,Bgof3Vmzq5,ADHD,66.0,70.0,Disease,229.0,247.0,Eggerthella genera,Species,increase,Disease$Species,"['affects', 'None', 'decrease', 'increase', 'Associated_with', 'Negative_correlation', 'worsen', 'possible', 'presence', 'causes', 'part_of']"
"In summary, the gut microbiota generates a series of bioactive metabolites to interact with host metabolism. These metabolites mainly include SCFAs, primary and secondary BAs, TMAO, and so on. Among these metabolites, some exert synergistic effects to promote host health by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system to control glucose metabolism. For example, SCFAs interact with human hormones such as GLP-1 and PYY to effect energy uptake and the development of obesity. SCFAs are beneficial for regulating appetite and energy intake, and preventing the formation of atherosclerosis. Other metabolites, such as TMAO and phenylacetylglutamine (PAGln), may be toxic. For example, TMAO may be proatherogenic to promote the process of thrombosis and atherosclerosis, thereby increasing the risk of cardiovascular events. Patients with CVDs had lower levels of SCFA generation and higher levels of TMAO production due to the change in gut microbiota. Furthermore, TMAO causes vascular endothelial damage and promotes the production of atherosclerotic plaques. TMAO can also increase the release of intracellular calcium ions, enhance the reactivity of platelets, and increase the risk of thrombosis to increase CVDs susceptibility. Besides, PAGln enhances platelet reactivity and thrombosis, leading to CVDs. Taken together, mounting evidence suggests that changes in gut microbiota metabolites are part of the crucial mechanisms by which the gut microbiota regulates the occurrence and development of CVDs.",18055127.0,1156,1168,TMAO,1063.0,1067.0,Chemical,1214.0,1218.0,CVDs,Disease,increase,Chemical$Disease,"['improve', 'increase', 'Associated_with', 'affects', 'None', 'treats', 'Marker/Mechanism', 'causes', 'prevents', 'Negative_correlation', 'possible', 'complicates', 'decrease', 'reveals', 'worsen', 'Interacts_with']"
"Experimental research confirms the hypothesis regarding SCFA reduction in autoimmune diseases (MS among others) and altered gut microbiota. A low level of SCFAs dysregulates Treg cell functions, leading to insufficient immune tolerance towards endogenous components and enteric microbiota. However, this process can be reversed by SCFAs supplementation (e.g., propionic acid). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing NFkappaB activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation and on microglial cells in vitro. TUDCA binds to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) expressed in microglial cells. This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS). Experimental results demonstrated that TUDCA acted as a double-edged sword, triggering microglia enhancement in anti-inflammatory and alternatively activated markers and on the other hand reducing the infiltration of macrophages and microglia with expressed pro-inflammatory markers. Interestingly, during neuroinflammation, microglial cells change their morphology, converting themselves into reactive macrophage-like forms. However, microglial cells are flexible, as they can sometimes polarize towards alternatively activated phenotypes, promoting CNS pathologies (proinflammatory or M1 microglia), or exert anti-inflammatory effects, boosting cell repair and remodeling. Bile acids were identified as nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor agonists, leading to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) depletion (in a mouse model) and neuroinflammatory process adjustment. The administration of the complex probiotic positively influenced the intestinal flora balance in patients diagnosed with MS. The probiotic prevented the onset of dysbiosis, significantly increasing the amount of Methanobrevibacter and Akkermansia, Prevotella, and Sutterella in MS patients, influencing gene expression and the production of beneficial bacterial metabolites.",16224291.0,-fD-BdANaE,1294,probiotic,2612.0,2621.0,Species,2718.0,2729.0,Akkermansia,Species,increase,Species$Species,"['None', 'part_of', 'increase', 'experiences', 'affects', 'Associated_with', 'start', 'improve', 'Location_of', 'presence', 'possible', 'decrease', 'worsen', 'Interacts_with', 'treats']"
"The interplay between the microbiome, microbial metabolites, and neuropathological processes present during neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and PD. The microbiome and microbial metabolites could regulate brain homeostasis via four different ways: 1. direct absorption of specific metabolites which have the ability to cross the BBB; 2. interaction between peripheral immune systems, which interact with brain glia cells and astrocytes; 3. influence on gut hormones and the enteroendocrine system; 4. communication via the vagus nerve.
