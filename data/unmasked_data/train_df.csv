"BAs, as by-products of cholesterol metabolism, are the main organic component of bile and are synthesized in hepatocytes. Cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) are primary BAs directly synthesized from cholesterol; secondary BAs include deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholic acid (LCA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and their glycine and taurine conjugated forms. BAs are excreted into the intestine to aid in the digestion and absorption of lipids and combine with farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and takeda-G-protein receptor 5 (TGR5) (Fig. 2). There is a strong biochemical relationship between BAs and gut microbiota. Some gut microbiota in healthy people can convert conjugated BAs into free BAs, and can transform BAs into secondary BAs with the help of bile salt hydrolase (BSH) and cholesterol 7-alpha hydroxy-lase (CYP7A1), so as to reduce blood cholesterol by affecting the enterohepatic circulation of BAs. Besides, the gut microbiota affects the metabolism of BAs by regulating the activity of BSH to reduce LDL cholesterol levels. BAs have bacteriostatic properties and an antimicrobial effect. BAs destroy the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane and thereby change the intestinal microecology. BAs also prevent bacteria from overgrowth and decrease inflammation. More importantly, BAs are also closely associated with CVDs. For example, BAs levels in the feces of patients with CVDs are different from those in healthy individuals. And BAs have been reported to regulate vascular tension and affect ion exchange on cardiomyocyte membranes, suggesting that regulating BAs by gut microbiota might be a treatment for CVDs.",17301489.0,WfP-qnxsYC,866,BAs,373.0,376.0,Chemical,451.0,457.0,lipids,Chemical,affects
"The PD microbiome has a diminished variety of bacterial taxonomic groups, especially the ones associated with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects and the increase of phyla, which has toxic effects. Predominantly, the reduction was observed in the Lachnospiraceae family, including Butyrivibrio, Pseudobutyrivibrio, Coprococcus, Blautia and SCFAs-producing Prevotellaceae. The increased amount of Enterobacteriaceae is linked to the severity of postural instability and walking difficulties. Moreover, the PD microbiome is characterised by increased Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium species and decreased amount of Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae. The overgrowth of Akkermansia spp. in PD patients may be strain-specific and can be related to immune-response alterations, decreased mucus thicknesses, and increased constipation. Faecalibacterium family is a crucial player producing SCFAs and anti-inflammatory metabolites, maintaining gut health. Faecalibacterium balance disturbances can lead to impaired gut-barrier function, increasing the risk of infection with enteric pathogens and boosting alpha-synuclein formation. Similarly, the Lachnospiraceae family can produce butyrate, important for the proper function of the gut epithelium. Decreased Lachnospiraceae quantity might aggravate gut inflammation, stimulate toxin production, and damage the integrity of the gut epithelial barrier. PD patients' intestinal microflora were characterised by a diminished abundance of Lachnospiraceae, which was positively correlated with PD progress, cognitive decline, and impaired motor functions. These microbiome's compositional changes correlate well with some metabolic switches. PD microbiota show reduced SCFAs production, decreased carbohydrate fermentation, and augmented proteolytic fermentation. Chen et al. demonstrated that the SCFA level was relevant to microbiota composition changes and the clinical severity of PD. The levels of SCFAs acetate, butyrate, and propionate in fecal samples of PD patients were significantly reduced, contrary to their elevated concentration in plasma. Rodent models of PD disease have shown a positive effect of SCFAs on behavior and PD symptoms. Butyrate, as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, exerts neuroprotective activity, reducing dopaminergic cell death, and motor impairment, and improving cognitive functions. Taken together, SCFAs play an important role in protection from PD disease and could be proposed as representative gut-oriented indicators for diversifying individuals with PD and placing disease progression.",16553034.0,HIbG6Q3d9d,lQePDhw-O_,Lachnospiraceae,1265.0,1280.0,Species,1334.0,1350.0,toxin production,Disease,Negative_correlation
"Experimental research confirms the hypothesis regarding SCFA reduction in autoimmune diseases (MS among others) and altered gut microbiota. A low level of SCFAs dysregulates Treg cell functions, leading to insufficient immune tolerance towards endogenous components and enteric microbiota. However, this process can be reversed by SCFAs supplementation (e.g., propionic acid). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing NFkappaB activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation and on microglial cells in vitro. TUDCA binds to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) expressed in microglial cells. This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS). Experimental results demonstrated that TUDCA acted as a double-edged sword, triggering microglia enhancement in anti-inflammatory and alternatively activated markers and on the other hand reducing the infiltration of macrophages and microglia with expressed pro-inflammatory markers. Interestingly, during neuroinflammation, microglial cells change their morphology, converting themselves into reactive macrophage-like forms. However, microglial cells are flexible, as they can sometimes polarize towards alternatively activated phenotypes, promoting CNS pathologies (proinflammatory or M1 microglia), or exert anti-inflammatory effects, boosting cell repair and remodeling. Bile acids were identified as nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor agonists, leading to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) depletion (in a mouse model) and neuroinflammatory process adjustment. The administration of the complex probiotic positively influenced the intestinal flora balance in patients diagnosed with MS. The probiotic prevented the onset of dysbiosis, significantly increasing the amount of Methanobrevibacter and Akkermansia, Prevotella, and Sutterella in MS patients, influencing gene expression and the production of beneficial bacterial metabolites.",16224291.0,-fD-BdANaE,1288,probiotic,2612.0,2621.0,Species,2645.0,2654.0,dysbiosis,Disease,prevents

"Schizophrenia is a severe neuropsychological disorder affecting approximately 1% of the world's population. 16S rRNA sequencing and diversity analyses of the fecal-derived microbiota obtained from patients suffering from schizophrenia indicated lower microbiome diversity. Performed analyses revealed the abundance of Proteobacteria and decreased amount of SCFAs synthesizing bacteria from Blautia, Coprococcus, and Roseburia species. It has been reported that butyrate and other SCFAs can cross the gastrointestinal endothelium and can pass through the BBB (exploiting active membrane transporters) and inhibit histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1). Abnormal microbiota can lead to reduced levels of butyrate and can cause the elevation of HDAC1 levels in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of patients with diagnosed schizophrenia, causing altered DNA methylation, impaired synaptic plasticity and short-term memory, and the development of impaired cognitive function and social abilities.",16212573.0,1521,p3uIKwG0UX,HDAC1,733.0,738.0,Gene,862.0,890.0,impaired synaptic plasticity,Disease,Associated_with
"Additionally, studies have also demonstrated that BAs reduce obesity susceptibility by increasing the expression and activity of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and increasing energy expenditure by GLP-1. For instance, BAs increased the expression of UCP1 in brown adipocytes via TGR5 to enhance the release of GLP-1. Thus, there is an interrelated complex relationship between BAs and obesity. It is essential to assess the role of changes in the composition of BAs in the downstream signaling pathways of the host receptors to gain a greater mechanistic understanding of obesity susceptibility.",18113543.0,FnRu1zVKuB,1651,BAs,215.0,218.0,Chemical,247.0,251.0,UCP1,Species,increase
"Besides the propagation of an inflammatory state, microbial endotoxins are probably involved in AD's inflammatory amyloidosis. Metagenomics analysis showed that patients suffering from cognitive dysfunctions related to amyloidosis demonstrated elevated amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neurotoxic compounds. In these patients, increased inflammation was probably related to Eubacterium deficiency, and an overabundance of gram-negative Escherichia and Shigella species, which are known amyloid producers. They manufacture ""curli"" amyloid fibers, accumulated extracellularly through an elaborated system. Further studies revealed that the overproduction of Abeta plaques is correlated with excessive growth of Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycobacterium and Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus spp.. Galloway et al. found Abeta in small intestine epithelial cells, suggesting that gut-derived amyloids could be absorbed and finally reach systemic circulation, where they can act as pro-inflammatory factors and trigger fibrillogenesis. Additionally, it was shown that amyloids generated by microbes can influence IL-17A and IL-22 proinflammatory cytokines production, considered as a key players in NFkappaB signaling, both associated with AD and capable of crossing the BBB and GI tract.",16171393.0,700,701,inflammation,346.0,358.0,Disease,395.0,405.0,deficiency,Disease,possible
"Recent studies underlined the important role of the gut microbiota in bidirectional crosstalk in Huntington's disease (HD). Huntington's disease has genetic origins related to trinucleotide expansion (CAG) in the huntingtin coding gene. Moreover, experiments performed in mice models revealed that the altered microbiota observed in the HD-suffering individuals at the pre-motor symptomatic stage highly influence health status. HD microbiota composition indicated dysbiosis, disturbances in cytokine levels, and an increase in sulphur metabolism characterized by hydrogen sulphide overproduction and negatively influencing gut health. Ultimately, the gut dysbiosis state was also described in a transgenic mice model representing Huntington's disease. Kong et al. found increased Bacteroidetes and decreased Firmicutes levels in a R6/1 transgenic mice model. In this study, dysbiosis was followed by body weight deterioration, gastrointestinal motility problems, and the loss of motor ability. Subsequent studies performed by the same group revealed the negative correlation between Blautia producta and butyrate production. Moreover, Prevotella scopos was negatively associated with ATP levels. Clinical trials performed on patients suffering from Huntington's disease revealed the prevalence of bacterial phyla belonging to Firmicutes (83%), Actinobacteria (9%), Bacteroidetes (4%), and Verrucomicrobia (1.1%) detected in the collected fecal samples. The results of performed human randomized clinical trials positively correlate with the data obtained in mouse models in which gut microbiota dysbiosis was observed.

"Aromatic amino acids including tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine are metabolized into indole and phenols by certain intestinal anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, and Peptostreptococcus. Tryptophan is decomposed into indole, indoleacetic acid, indole-3-lactic acid, 3-methylindole (skatole) and other indole compounds under the action of tryptophanase. Tryptophanase is the key enzyme that generates indole. The activity of the enzyme is easily induced by the substrate tryptophan, so when the amount of tryptophan changes in the colonic environment, the content of indole will fluctuate greatly. Of note, the metabolic products of aromatic amino acids generated by gut microbiota have a great impact on the pathology of cardiometabolic diseases. For example, indole propionic acid is associated with insulin sensitivity and appears to reduce the risk of diabetes. Moreover, the gut microbiota metabolizes dietary tryptophan to indoxyl, which further generates indoxyl sulfate through sulfonation. Excessive accumulation of indoxyl sulfate causes cardiomyocyte damage and increases thrombus formation. Another phenol compound, 4-methylphenol, can inhibit the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into mature adipocytes, induce apoptosis and reduce glucose uptake. In addition, benzoic acid is an aromatic carboxylic acid synthesized by colonic microorganisms by metabolizing dietary aromatic compounds.

"Mechanically, current studies suggest that SCFAs may exert their functions through acting as energy substrates and maintaining metabolic integration by a variety of different downstream regulatory mechanisms, such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPRs) with GPR41/Recombinant Free Fatty Acid Receptor (FFAR3), GPR43/FFAR2, GPR109A, Olfactory Receptors 78 (Olfr78) in endocrine cells of the gut wall, as well as histone deacetylases (HDACs) (Fig. 2). GPR41 regulates host energy acquisition and promotes the catabolism of glucose and lipids. The decreased SCFAs may cause less activated GPR41 and higher levels of energy uptake. In addition, it has also been reported that the lower production of SCFAs in gut microbiota would increase the host's capability of obtaining energy from the diet. SCFAs from bacterial fermentation promote the secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY) through GPR43 and GPR41 from intestinal L cells. GLP-1 increased pancreatic insulin secretion, and inhibited the production of glucagon. Deletion of GLP-1 abolished the beneficial effects of prebiotics on weight gain, glucose metabolism, and inflammatory pathway activation.

"At the end of this chapter, it is worth mentioning the fact that the interaction between the microbiome and the host is bidirectional, and some metabolic changes, which could be a pathological result of disease progression, also influence microbiome metabolism. A good example is a disturbance in cholesterol homeostasis, which correlates with an augmented probability of Alzheimer's disease occurrence. In addition, alteration of the intestinal microbiota composition with the subsequent fluctuations in the serum and brain levels of bile acids (BAs) is involved in the development of AD. BAs can act as detergents, affecting BBB permeability, and incrementing brain influx of peripheral cholesterol and BAs. Therefore, proper cholesterol elimination pathways play a crucial role in AD prevention and treatment. The gut microbiome is a main ""organ"" metabolizing secondary bile acids. Peripheral cholesterol is eliminated mainly through its liver conversion to BAs. The gut microbiota performs BA transformation via deconjugation and dehydroxylation, leading to secondary BA formation. Nho et al. investigated the correlation between neurodegeneration and BAs, B-amyloid, and tau protein concentration. The application of targeted metabolomics enabled the determination of the association between intestinal microbiota-derived secondary bile acids and sera BAs. Interestingly, the analysis indicated an imbalanced BA ratio, underlying an increased amount of secondary BAs over primary ones. Another clinical study confirmed the correlation between bile acid metabolic profile and the prevalence of AD and mild cognitive impairment, showing similar BA ratio disruptions. Decreased cognitive functions were positively associated with increased concentrations of secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid, and glycolithocholic acid.

"In summary, the gut microbiota generates a series of bioactive metabolites to interact with host metabolism. These metabolites mainly include SCFAs, primary and secondary BAs, TMAO, and so on. Among these metabolites, some exert synergistic effects to promote host health by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system to control glucose metabolism. For example, SCFAs interact with human hormones such as GLP-1 and PYY to effect energy uptake and the development of obesity. SCFAs are beneficial for regulating appetite and energy intake, and preventing the formation of atherosclerosis. Other metabolites, such as TMAO and phenylacetylglutamine (PAGln), may be toxic. For example, TMAO may be proatherogenic to promote the process of thrombosis and atherosclerosis, thereby increasing the risk of cardiovascular events. Patients with CVDs had lower levels of SCFA generation and higher levels of TMAO production due to the change in gut microbiota. Furthermore, TMAO causes vascular endothelial damage and promotes the production of atherosclerotic plaques. TMAO can also increase the release of intracellular calcium ions, enhance the reactivity of platelets, and increase the risk of thrombosis to increase CVDs susceptibility. Besides, PAGln enhances platelet reactivity and thrombosis, leading to CVDs.

In addition, it has also been reported that the lower production of SCFAs in gut microbiota would increase the host's capability of obtaining energy from the diet. SCFAs from bacterial fermentation promote the secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY) through GPR43 and GPR41 from intestinal L cells. GLP-1 increased pancreatic insulin secretion, and inhibited the production of glucagon. Deletion of GLP-1 abolished the beneficial effects of prebiotics on weight gain, glucose metabolism, and inflammatory pathway activation. Moreover, PYY increases satiety, reduces food intake, inhibits intestinal motility, and increases the intestinal transit rate.",18395273.0,1dz12Qajtc,706,SCFA,791.0,795.0,Chemical,850.0,873.0,glucagon-like peptide 1,Gene,increase

"It is currently controversial whether supplementation with BCAAs would increase circulating BCAAs, thereby increasing the risk of diabetes. And reducing BCAAs intake promotes fat mass loss and insulin sensitivity in mice with obesity. A high BCAAs diet causes excessive feeding, mainly due to excessive appetite. Adding threonine to balance the composition of amino acids in the diet can inhibit food intake. Nevertheless, some studies have found that supplementary BCAAs, such as isoleucine and leucine, can improve insulin resistance and reduce weight to lower the risk of obesity and diabetes. The inconsistency may be due to the individual state of energy excess or energy deficiency. In terms of an excessive energy state, such as in patients with obesity or diabetes who have an impaired ability to degrade BCAAs, BCAAs and related metabolites accumulate in circulation to reduce insulin sensitivity and cause insulin resistance. In most elderly people with inadequate energy or athletes who maintain good fitness habits, BCAAs can improve the form of metabolism. In these people, BCAAs decomposition metabolism is increased by regulatory factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha coactivator (PGC-1alpha) and PPARalpha, so that BCAAs levels are maintained in a steady state, which ultimately promotes glucose intake and insulin sensitivity. This was supported by the study of Newgard, who pointed out that dietary intake of BCAAs might interact with a high-fat diet to induce abnormal metabolic phenotypes such as insulin resistance. Mice fed BCAAs alone did not develop insulin resistance. However, when mice were fed a high-fat diet supplemented with BCAAs, they developed insulin resistance. This study suggested that BCAAs only lead to insulin resistance in the presence of excess energy intake. Therefore, more studies are needed to explore the supplementation with BCAAs and insulin resistance as well as the development of cardiovascular risk factors.",19341206.0,2471,2483,good fitness habits,1007.0,1026.0,Disease,1770.0,1777.0,insulin,Gene,None
"The PD microbiome has a diminished variety of bacterial taxonomic groups, especially the ones associated with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects and the increase of phyla, which has toxic effects. Predominantly, the reduction was observed in the Lachnospiraceae family, including Butyrivibrio, Pseudobutyrivibrio, Coprococcus, Blautia and SCFAs-producing Prevotellaceae. The increased amount of Enterobacteriaceae is linked to the severity of postural instability and walking difficulties. Moreover, the PD microbiome is characterised by increased Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium species and decreased amount of Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae. The overgrowth of Akkermansia spp. in PD patients may be strain-specific and can be related to immune-response alterations, decreased mucus thicknesses, and increased constipation. Faecalibacterium family is a crucial player producing SCFAs and anti-inflammatory metabolites, maintaining gut health. Faecalibacterium balance disturbances can lead to impaired gut-barrier function, increasing the risk of infection with enteric pathogens and boosting alpha-synuclein formation. Similarly, the Lachnospiraceae family can produce butyrate, important for the proper function of the gut epithelium. Decreased Lachnospiraceae quantity might aggravate gut inflammation, stimulate toxin production, and damage the integrity of the gut epithelial barrier. PD patients' intestinal microflora were characterised by a diminished abundance of Lachnospiraceae, which was positively correlated with PD progress, cognitive decline, and impaired motor functions. These microbiome's compositional changes correlate well with some metabolic switches. PD microbiota show reduced SCFAs production, decreased carbohydrate fermentation, and augmented proteolytic fermentation. Chen et al. demonstrated that the SCFA level was relevant to microbiota composition changes and the clinical severity of PD. The levels of SCFAs acetate, butyrate, and propionate in fecal samples of PD patients were significantly reduced, contrary to their elevated concentration in plasma. Rodent models of PD disease have shown a positive effect of SCFAs on behavior and PD symptoms. Butyrate, as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, exerts neuroprotective activity, reducing dopaminergic cell death, and motor impairment, and improving cognitive functions.

"Several studies have suggested that different BAs profiles are closely related to obesity. It was reported that 12-hydroxylated (12-OH) BAs such as CA and DCA increase obesity susceptibility, while non-12-OH BAs such as CDCA, UDCA and LCA reduce obesity susceptibility. Mice with higher levels of non-12-OH BAs gained weight slowly and had less metabolic disturbance, while the rapidly gaining weight mice had significantly lower levels of non-12-OH BAs such as UDCA. UDCA intake significantly reduced weight gain and metabolic disturbances induced by high-fat diet. Another study also provided evidence that a high-fat diet caused obesity by increasing the levels of 12-OH BAs. In a rat model, high-fat diet caused increases in the total BAs, DCA and taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA) in plasma and liver tissues, and increases in DCA in intestinal tissues and feces.

"Experimental research confirms the hypothesis regarding SCFA reduction in autoimmune diseases (MS among others) and altered gut microbiota. A low level of SCFAs dysregulates Treg cell functions, leading to insufficient immune tolerance towards endogenous components and enteric microbiota. However, this process can be reversed by SCFAs supplementation (e.g., propionic acid). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing NFkappaB activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation and on microglial cells in vitro. TUDCA binds to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) expressed in microglial cells. This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS). Experimental results demonstrated that TUDCA acted as a double-edged sword, triggering microglia enhancement in anti-inflammatory and alternatively activated markers and on the other hand reducing the infiltration of macrophages and microglia with expressed pro-inflammatory markers. Interestingly, during neuroinflammation, microglial cells change their morphology, converting themselves into reactive macrophage-like forms. However, microglial cells are flexible, as they can sometimes polarize towards alternatively activated phenotypes, promoting CNS pathologies (proinflammatory or M1 microglia), or exert anti-inflammatory effects, boosting cell repair and remodeling. Bile acids were identified as nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor agonists, leading to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) depletion (in a mouse model) and neuroinflammatory process adjustment. The administration of the complex probiotic positively influenced the intestinal flora balance in patients diagnosed with MS. The probiotic prevented the onset of dysbiosis, significantly increasing the amount of Methanobrevibacter and Akkermansia, Prevotella, and Sutterella in MS patients, influencing gene expression and the production of beneficial bacterial metabolites.",16224291.0,1290,9SUM-GtJ_K,mouse,2427.0,2432.0,Species,2406.0,2409.0,EAE,Disease,experiences

"In fact, changes in the function of gut microecology and gut microbiota may cause the occurrence and exacerbation of various diseases. It was found that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota may lead to decreased cardiac function and increased cardiomyopathy as well as cardiac insufficiency, which is of great significance in predicting CVDs and also has important predictive significance for the prognosis of adverse cardiovascular events. The gut microbiota has been reported to be associated with CVDs and its corresponding risk factors, such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, and insulin resistance. These risk factors may affect the composition and the diversity of gut microbiota. In addition, gut dysbiosis is also linked to inflammation, oxidative stress, platelet activity, thrombosis and atherosclerosis, which contribute to the progression of CVDs. The possible mechanism of gut microbiota dysbiosis related to CVDs includes its role in increasing intestinal permeability and triggering inflammation via the LPS/TLR4 as well as NLRP3 pathways, thereby ultimately contributing to the development of CVDs. In short, the inflammation directly triggers by gut microbiota is one of the possible mechanisms of CVDs susceptibility, and material metabolism affected by gut microbiota was proposed to play a role as well.",17039945.0,U_P-E7aoLO,496,LPS,1011.0,1014.0,Chemical,1015.0,1019.0,TLR4,Species,Interacts_with
"BAs, as by-products of cholesterol metabolism, are the main organic component of bile and are synthesized in hepatocytes. Cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) are primary BAs directly synthesized from cholesterol; secondary BAs include deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholic acid (LCA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and their glycine and taurine conjugated forms. BAs are excreted into the intestine to aid in the digestion and absorption of lipids and combine with farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and takeda-G-protein receptor 5 (TGR5) (Fig. 2). There is a strong biochemical relationship between BAs and gut microbiota. Some gut microbiota in healthy people can convert conjugated BAs into free BAs, and can transform BAs into secondary BAs with the help of bile salt hydrolase (BSH) and cholesterol 7-alpha hydroxy-lase (CYP7A1), so as to reduce blood cholesterol by affecting the enterohepatic circulation of BAs. Besides, the gut microbiota affects the metabolism of BAs by regulating the activity of BSH to reduce LDL cholesterol levels. BAs have bacteriostatic properties and an antimicrobial effect. BAs destroy the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane and thereby change the intestinal microecology. BAs also prevent bacteria from overgrowth and decrease inflammation. More importantly, BAs are also closely associated with CVDs. For example, BAs levels in the feces of patients with CVDs are different from those in healthy individuals.

"The mechanism by which BCAAs induce insulin resistance is still not fully understood. The rise of BCAA levels is found to regulate glycolipid metabolism, cause insulin resistance, and increase the risk of T2D. Other animal experiments have shown that elevated BCAAs are transferred to skeletal muscle, and are interfered with lipid metabolism, which causes the accumulation of lipid metabolites and ultimately leads to skeletal muscle insulin resistance. Additionally, BCAAs are the key regulatory factor of mTORC1. It activates mTORC1 and ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (S6K1) by inducing the phosphorylation of IRS1, blocking the insulin signaling pathway, and eventually causing insulin resistance. However, 2 other studies have shown that BCAAs may exert their functions without mTORC1. One study reported that the metabolites of BCAAs, 3-hydroxy isobutyrate, could cause insulin resistance by promoting skeletal muscle sprouting.

UDCA intake significantly reduced weight gain and metabolic disturbances induced by high-fat diet. Another study also provided evidence that a high-fat diet caused obesity by increasing the levels of 12-OH BAs. In a rat model, high-fat diet caused increases in the total BAs, DCA and taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA) in plasma and liver tissues, and increases in DCA in intestinal tissues and feces. Therefore, changing the proportion of 12-OH BAs and non-12-OH BAs may have an impact on the risk of obesity.",18108132.0,1582,1583,mice,401.0,405.0,Species,684.0,687.0,rat,Species,None

"SCFAs may prevent obesity by regulating the homeostasis of glucose and lipid metabolism. For instance, acetate decreases appetite and nutrient intake. Propionate activates intestinal gluconeogenesis by a gut-brain neural circuit to promote energy balance. Butyrate provides energy for colon cells, maintains the integrity of intestinal walls, and improves the insulin response, which activates gluconeogenesis to maintain the balance of glucose and energy through the cAMP pathway. And one study indicated that oral butyrate intake prevents obesity and insulin resistance. Furthermore, the role of SCFAs in metabolic hemostasis is related to other factors. Adenosine monophosphate activating protein (AMPK) is a heterotrimeric enzyme that stimulates liver and muscle fatty acid oxidation pathways. SCFAs promote the activity of AMPK and improve its ability to oxidize fatty acids. Last, SCFAs can affect the development of dyslipidemia. SCFAs increase the expression of fasting-induced adipose factor (FIAF), a circulating lipoprotein lipase inhibitor, by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-gamma), thereby decreasing the activity of lipoproteinases and inhibiting lipolysis in adipose tissues. This process promotes the storage of lipids and the formation of adipose tissue, thus promoting the occurrence of obesity.",18107372.0,kM7N_PfnTU,1515,SCFAs,0.0,5.0,Chemical,71.0,76.0,lipid,Chemical,improve

The previously mentioned species belong to Gram-negative bacteria, which are capable of producing huge amounts of pro-inflammatory lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), thereby causing intestinal inflammation and gut barrier disruption. Increased gut permeability permits the transport and the systemic and brain accumulation of LPS or other bacterial toxins and the propagation of an inflammatory state.

"In summary, the gut microbiota generates a series of bioactive metabolites to interact with host metabolism. These metabolites mainly include SCFAs, primary and secondary BAs, TMAO, and so on. Among these metabolites, some exert synergistic effects to promote host health by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system to control glucose metabolism. For example, SCFAs interact with human hormones such as GLP-1 and PYY to effect energy uptake and the development of obesity. SCFAs are beneficial for regulating appetite and energy intake, and preventing the formation of atherosclerosis. Other metabolites, such as TMAO and phenylacetylglutamine (PAGln), may be toxic. For example, TMAO may be proatherogenic to promote the process of thrombosis and atherosclerosis, thereby increasing the risk of cardiovascular events. Patients with CVDs had lower levels of SCFA generation and higher levels of TMAO production due to the change in gut microbiota. Furthermore, TMAO causes vascular endothelial damage and promotes the production of atherosclerotic plaques. TMAO can also increase the release of intracellular calcium ions, enhance the reactivity of platelets, and increase the risk of thrombosis to increase CVDs susceptibility. Besides, PAGln enhances platelet reactivity and thrombosis, leading to CVDs. Taken together, mounting evidence suggests that changes in gut microbiota metabolites are part of the crucial mechanisms by which the gut microbiota regulates the occurrence and development of CVDs.",18055127.0,1158,1169,PAGln,1244.0,1249.0,Chemical,1283.0,1293.0,thrombosis,Disease,increase
"Besides the propagation of an inflammatory state, microbial endotoxins are probably involved in AD's inflammatory amyloidosis. Metagenomics analysis showed that patients suffering from cognitive dysfunctions related to amyloidosis demonstrated elevated amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neurotoxic compounds. In these patients, increased inflammation was probably related to Eubacterium deficiency, and an overabundance of gram-negative Escherichia and Shigella species, which are known amyloid producers. They manufacture ""curli"" amyloid fibers, accumulated extracellularly through an elaborated system. Further studies revealed that the overproduction of Abeta plaques is correlated with excessive growth of Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycobacterium and Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus spp.. Galloway et al. found Abeta in small intestine epithelial cells, suggesting that gut-derived amyloids could be absorbed and finally reach systemic circulation, where they can act as pro-inflammatory factors and trigger fibrillogenesis.

"The main end product of bacterial fermentation, and therefore the most predominant, is the SCFA propionic acid (PA), which positively influences CNS regeneration processes such as remyelination (due to the former increase of the amount of intestinal T regulatory cells and protecting against the white matter and axonal loss). Hoyles et al. demonstrated the contribution of propionate to the BBB integrity and the modulation of gut-brain axis. BBB homeostasis and integrity are necessary for proper CNS development and function. Recently, a positive correlation between microbial-induced BBB dysfunction (barrier integrity disturbances followed by leakage) and disorders such as AD has been established. Another member of the SCFAs family, which has a documented influence on homeostasis and AD progression, is butyrate, an important driver of metabolic processes with the ability to influence intestinal macrophages, increasing immunomodulation and decreasing the histone deacetylase inhibition-mediated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Butyrate, as an SCFA, influences the immune response crossing the BBB and drives the maturation and metabolism of microglia cells. It regulates the secretion of gut hormones, such as glucagon-like peptide-1, which can improve hippocampus neuroplasticity.

"The PD microbiome has a diminished variety of bacterial taxonomic groups, especially the ones associated with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects and the increase of phyla, which has toxic effects. Predominantly, the reduction was observed in the Lachnospiraceae family, including Butyrivibrio, Pseudobutyrivibrio, Coprococcus, Blautia and SCFAs-producing Prevotellaceae. The increased amount of Enterobacteriaceae is linked to the severity of postural instability and walking difficulties. Moreover, the PD microbiome is characterised by increased Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium species and decreased amount of Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae. The overgrowth of Akkermansia spp. in PD patients may be strain-specific and can be related to immune-response alterations, decreased mucus thicknesses, and increased constipation. Faecalibacterium family is a crucial player producing SCFAs and anti-inflammatory metabolites, maintaining gut health. Faecalibacterium balance disturbances can lead to impaired gut-barrier function, increasing the risk of infection with enteric pathogens and boosting alpha-synuclein formation. Similarly, the Lachnospiraceae family can produce butyrate, important for the proper function of the gut epithelium. Decreased Lachnospiraceae quantity might aggravate gut inflammation, stimulate toxin production, and damage the integrity of the gut epithelial barrier. PD patients' intestinal microflora were characterised by a diminished abundance of Lachnospiraceae, which was positively correlated with PD progress, cognitive decline, and impaired motor functions. These microbiome's compositional changes correlate well with some metabolic switches.

"Mechanically, current studies suggest that SCFAs may exert their functions through acting as energy substrates and maintaining metabolic integration by a variety of different downstream regulatory mechanisms, such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPRs) with GPR41/Recombinant Free Fatty Acid Receptor (FFAR3), GPR43/FFAR2, GPR109A, Olfactory Receptors 78 (Olfr78) in endocrine cells of the gut wall, as well as histone deacetylases (HDACs) (Fig. 2). GPR41 regulates host energy acquisition and promotes the catabolism of glucose and lipids. The decreased SCFAs may cause less activated GPR41 and higher levels of energy uptake. In addition, it has also been reported that the lower production of SCFAs in gut microbiota would increase the host's capability of obtaining energy from the diet. SCFAs from bacterial fermentation promote the secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY) through GPR43 and GPR41 from intestinal L cells. GLP-1 increased pancreatic insulin secretion, and inhibited the production of glucagon.

"It is currently controversial whether supplementation with BCAAs would increase circulating BCAAs, thereby increasing the risk of diabetes. And reducing BCAAs intake promotes fat mass loss and insulin sensitivity in mice with obesity. A high BCAAs diet causes excessive feeding, mainly due to excessive appetite. Adding threonine to balance the composition of amino acids in the diet can inhibit food intake. Nevertheless, some studies have found that supplementary BCAAs, such as isoleucine and leucine, can improve insulin resistance and reduce weight to lower the risk of obesity and diabetes. The inconsistency may be due to the individual state of energy excess or energy deficiency. In terms of an excessive energy state, such as in patients with obesity or diabetes who have an impaired ability to degrade BCAAs, BCAAs and related metabolites accumulate in circulation to reduce insulin sensitivity and cause insulin resistance. In most elderly people with inadequate energy or athletes who maintain good fitness habits, BCAAs can improve the form of metabolism. In these people, BCAAs decomposition metabolism is increased by regulatory factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha coactivator (PGC-1alpha) and PPARalpha, so that BCAAs levels are maintained in a steady state, which ultimately promotes glucose intake and insulin sensitivity. This was supported by the study of Newgard, who pointed out that dietary intake of BCAAs might interact with a high-fat diet to induce abnormal metabolic phenotypes such as insulin resistance. Mice fed BCAAs alone did not develop insulin resistance. However, when mice were fed a high-fat diet supplemented with BCAAs, they developed insulin resistance. This study suggested that BCAAs only lead to insulin resistance in the presence of excess energy intake.

In patients with CVDs and corresponding risk factors, the composition and ratio of gut microbiota have significant differences compared with their healthy counterparts. Therefore, gut microbiota dysbiosis, gut microbiota-generated metabolites, and the related signaling pathway may serve as explanations for some of the mechanisms about the occurrence and development of CVDs.

"BAs, as by-products of cholesterol metabolism, are the main organic component of bile and are synthesized in hepatocytes. Cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) are primary BAs directly synthesized from cholesterol; secondary BAs include deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholic acid (LCA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and their glycine and taurine conjugated forms. BAs are excreted into the intestine to aid in the digestion and absorption of lipids and combine with farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and takeda-G-protein receptor 5 (TGR5) (Fig. 2). There is a strong biochemical relationship between BAs and gut microbiota. Some gut microbiota in healthy people can convert conjugated BAs into free BAs, and can transform BAs into secondary BAs with the help of bile salt hydrolase (BSH) and cholesterol 7-alpha hydroxy-lase (CYP7A1), so as to reduce blood cholesterol by affecting the enterohepatic circulation of BAs. Besides, the gut microbiota affects the metabolism of BAs by regulating the activity of BSH to reduce LDL cholesterol levels. BAs have bacteriostatic properties and an antimicrobial effect. BAs destroy the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane and thereby change the intestinal microecology. BAs also prevent bacteria from overgrowth and decrease inflammation. More importantly, BAs are also closely associated with CVDs. For example, BAs levels in the feces of patients with CVDs are different from those in healthy individuals.

"The gut microbiota is critical to human health, such as digesting nutrients, forming the intestinal epithelial barrier, regulating immune function, producing vitamins and hormones, and producing metabolites to interact with the host. Meanwhile, increasing evidence indicates that the gut microbiota has a strong correlation with the occurrence, progression and treatment of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). In patients with CVDs and corresponding risk factors, the composition and ratio of gut microbiota have significant differences compared with their healthy counterparts. Therefore, gut microbiota dysbiosis, gut microbiota-generated metabolites, and the related signaling pathway may serve as explanations for some of the mechanisms about the occurrence and development of CVDs. Several studies have also demonstrated that many traditional and latest therapeutic treatments of CVDs are associated with the gut microbiota and its generated metabolites and related signaling pathways. Given that information, we summarized the latest advances in the current research regarding the effect of gut microbiota on health, the main cardiovascular risk factors, and CVDs, highlighted the roles and mechanisms of several metabolites, and introduced corresponding promising treatments for CVDs regarding the gut microbiota. Therefore, this review mainly focuses on exploring the role of gut microbiota related metabolites and their therapeutic potential in CVDs, which may eventually provide better solutions in the development of therapeutic treatment as well as the prevention of CVDs.",16509972.0,z4XyjzszfS,22,gut microbiota-generated metabolites,612.0,648.0,Chemical,777.0,781.0,CVDs,Disease,Marker/Mechanism
"Aromatic amino acids including tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine are metabolized into indole and phenols by certain intestinal anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, and Peptostreptococcus. Tryptophan is decomposed into indole, indoleacetic acid, indole-3-lactic acid, 3-methylindole (skatole) and other indole compounds under the action of tryptophanase. Tryptophanase is the key enzyme that generates indole. The activity of the enzyme is easily induced by the substrate tryptophan, so when the amount of tryptophan changes in the colonic environment, the content of indole will fluctuate greatly. Of note, the metabolic products of aromatic amino acids generated by gut microbiota have a great impact on the pathology of cardiometabolic diseases. For example, indole propionic acid is associated with insulin sensitivity and appears to reduce the risk of diabetes. Moreover, the gut microbiota metabolizes dietary tryptophan to indoxyl, which further generates indoxyl sulfate through sulfonation. Excessive accumulation of indoxyl sulfate causes cardiomyocyte damage and increases thrombus formation. Another phenol compound, 4-methylphenol, can inhibit the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into mature adipocytes, induce apoptosis and reduce glucose uptake. In addition, benzoic acid is an aromatic carboxylic acid synthesized by colonic microorganisms by metabolizing dietary aromatic compounds. Plasma benzoic acid levels were found to be elevated in the rat model of polygenic diabetes.",17445219.0,1049,1044,skatole,340.0,347.0,Chemical,245.0,255.0,Tryptophan,Chemical,Physically_related_to

The death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta is characteristic of PD. This disease causes symptoms such as rest tremors, bradykinesia, muscular rigidity, and postural stability problems. Parkinson's disease is characterized not only by neurological disorders, but also by gastrointestinal disturbances, including nausea, constipation (affecting more than 70% of PD patients), vomiting, reduced colonic motility, and gut microbiota changes (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth among many others).

"The PD microbiome has a diminished variety of bacterial taxonomic groups, especially the ones associated with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects and the increase of phyla, which has toxic effects. Predominantly, the reduction was observed in the Lachnospiraceae family, including Butyrivibrio, Pseudobutyrivibrio, Coprococcus, Blautia and SCFAs-producing Prevotellaceae. The increased amount of Enterobacteriaceae is linked to the severity of postural instability and walking difficulties. Moreover, the PD microbiome is characterised by increased Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium species and decreased amount of Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae. The overgrowth of Akkermansia spp. in PD patients may be strain-specific and can be related to immune-response alterations, decreased mucus thicknesses, and increased constipation. Faecalibacterium family is a crucial player producing SCFAs and anti-inflammatory metabolites, maintaining gut health. Faecalibacterium balance disturbances can lead to impaired gut-barrier function, increasing the risk of infection with enteric pathogens and boosting alpha-synuclein formation. Similarly, the Lachnospiraceae family can produce butyrate, important for the proper function of the gut epithelium. Decreased Lachnospiraceae quantity might aggravate gut inflammation, stimulate toxin production, and damage the integrity of the gut epithelial barrier. PD patients' intestinal microflora were characterised by a diminished abundance of Lachnospiraceae, which was positively correlated with PD progress, cognitive decline, and impaired motor functions. These microbiome's compositional changes correlate well with some metabolic switches. PD microbiota show reduced SCFAs production, decreased carbohydrate fermentation, and augmented proteolytic fermentation. Chen et al. demonstrated that the SCFA level was relevant to microbiota composition changes and the clinical severity of PD. The levels of SCFAs acetate, butyrate, and propionate in fecal samples of PD patients were significantly reduced, contrary to their elevated concentration in plasma. Rodent models of PD disease have shown a positive effect of SCFAs on behavior and PD symptoms. Butyrate, as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, exerts neuroprotective activity, reducing dopaminergic cell death, and motor impairment, and improving cognitive functions. Taken together, SCFAs play an important role in protection from PD disease and could be proposed as representative gut-oriented indicators for diversifying individuals with PD and placing disease progression.",16553034.0,to5CIDU5Y8,999,SCFAs,2387.0,2392.0,Chemical,2544.0,2546.0,PD,Disease,improve
"Previous results have indicated that the metabolic regulation of BAs may be associated with T2D but the specific changes in BAs and the related mechanisms remain to be studied. It is also unclear how the different types of BAs change in patients with T2D. A study also suggested that patients with T2D had no change in plasma total BAs, but had an increase in DCA and a decrease in CDCA in plasma. Another study found that the plasma total BA concentration in patients with T2D was not significantly different from that of healthy people; however, the concentration of DCA in the plasma of patients with T2D was significantly higher than that of healthy controls. The mechanism may be that FXR and TGR5 are inhibited during insulin resistance, and the most effective natural ligands of the receptors, DCA and CA, are compensatorily increased. Besides, circulating BAs levels including DCA, TCA, TDCA, and glycodeoxycholic acid, are positively associated with the risk of T2D, while taurohyodeoxycholic acid is negatively associated with diabetes. This may be due to the fact that hydrophobic BAs isoforms (such as DCA) have been shown to be involved in inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress with glucose dysregulation, and hydrophilic BAs isoforms (such as tauroursodeoxycholic acid) have been shown to prevent inflammation and enhance insulin sensitivity.",18340523.0,bEy-orNMhi,2029,insulin resistance,724.0,742.0,Disease,801.0,804.0,DCA,Chemical,increase

"Experimental research confirms the hypothesis regarding SCFA reduction in autoimmune diseases (MS among others) and altered gut microbiota. A low level of SCFAs dysregulates Treg cell functions, leading to insufficient immune tolerance towards endogenous components and enteric microbiota. However, this process can be reversed by SCFAs supplementation (e.g., propionic acid). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing NFkappaB activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation and on microglial cells in vitro. TUDCA binds to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) expressed in microglial cells. This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS). Experimental results demonstrated that TUDCA acted as a double-edged sword, triggering microglia enhancement in anti-inflammatory and alternatively activated markers and on the other hand reducing the infiltration of macrophages and microglia with expressed pro-inflammatory markers. Interestingly, during neuroinflammation, microglial cells change their morphology, converting themselves into reactive macrophage-like forms. However, microglial cells are flexible, as they can sometimes polarize towards alternatively activated phenotypes, promoting CNS pathologies (proinflammatory or M1 microglia), or exert anti-inflammatory effects, boosting cell repair and remodeling. Bile acids were identified as nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor agonists, leading to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) depletion (in a mouse model) and neuroinflammatory process adjustment. The administration of the complex probiotic positively influenced the intestinal flora balance in patients diagnosed with MS.

"Several studies have suggested that different BAs profiles are closely related to obesity.

Mice with higher levels of non-12-OH BAs gained weight slowly and had less metabolic disturbance, while the rapidly gaining weight mice had significantly lower levels of non-12-OH BAs such as UDCA. UDCA intake significantly reduced weight gain and metabolic disturbances induced by high-fat diet. Another study also provided evidence that a high-fat diet caused obesity by increasing the levels of 12-OH BAs. In a rat model, high-fat diet caused increases in the total BAs, DCA and taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA) in plasma and liver tissues, and increases in DCA in intestinal tissues and feces.

"Besides the propagation of an inflammatory state, microbial endotoxins are probably involved in AD's inflammatory amyloidosis. Metagenomics analysis showed that patients suffering from cognitive dysfunctions related to amyloidosis demonstrated elevated amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neurotoxic compounds.

"The origins of Parkinson's disease are the result of many factors such as increased age, polygenic factors (disease-segregating mutations in alpha-synuclein protein occurring in 15% of PD patients), toxins, and infectious agents. In 2006, Braak et al. assumed the gut-related origins of Parkinson's disease. One of the key pathological hallmarks of PD is Lewy bodies, being eosinophilic inclusion forms of misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates. Importantly, alpha-synuclein protein has a tendency to misfold and form aggregates. Its accumulation has been detected during bacterial and viral infections in the gut. Moreover, it can be recognized as a characteristic indicator of PD neural degeneration. This protein aggregate can boost the local immune response. Interestingly, alpha-synuclein deposition has been confirmed in the neurons of the intestinal submucosa, together with a possibility of the alpha-synuclein transport to the brain via the vagus nerve (translocation of prion-like proteins). Misfolded alpha-synuclein triggers neuronal dysfunction and progressive degeneration, thereby enabling disease progression.

"It is currently controversial whether supplementation with BCAAs would increase circulating BCAAs, thereby increasing the risk of diabetes. And reducing BCAAs intake promotes fat mass loss and insulin sensitivity in mice with obesity. A high BCAAs diet causes excessive feeding, mainly due to excessive appetite. Adding threonine to balance the composition of amino acids in the diet can inhibit food intake. Nevertheless, some studies have found that supplementary BCAAs, such as isoleucine and leucine, can improve insulin resistance and reduce weight to lower the risk of obesity and diabetes. The inconsistency may be due to the individual state of energy excess or energy deficiency. In terms of an excessive energy state, such as in patients with obesity or diabetes who have an impaired ability to degrade BCAAs, BCAAs and related metabolites accumulate in circulation to reduce insulin sensitivity and cause insulin resistance. In most elderly people with inadequate energy or athletes who maintain good fitness habits, BCAAs can improve the form of metabolism. In these people, BCAAs decomposition metabolism is increased by regulatory factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha coactivator (PGC-1alpha) and PPARalpha, so that BCAAs levels are maintained in a steady state, which ultimately promotes glucose intake and insulin sensitivity. This was supported by the study of Newgard, who pointed out that dietary intake of BCAAs might interact with a high-fat diet to induce abnormal metabolic phenotypes such as insulin resistance. Mice fed BCAAs alone did not develop insulin resistance. However, when mice were fed a high-fat diet supplemented with BCAAs, they developed insulin resistance. This study suggested that BCAAs only lead to insulin resistance in the presence of excess energy intake.

"Recent studies underlined the important role of the gut microbiota in bidirectional crosstalk in Huntington's disease (HD). Huntington's disease has genetic origins related to trinucleotide expansion (CAG) in the huntingtin coding gene. Moreover, experiments performed in mice models revealed that the altered microbiota observed in the HD-suffering individuals at the pre-motor symptomatic stage highly influence health status. HD microbiota composition indicated dysbiosis, disturbances in cytokine levels, and an increase in sulphur metabolism characterized by hydrogen sulphide overproduction and negatively influencing gut health. Ultimately, the gut dysbiosis state was also described in a transgenic mice model representing Huntington's disease. Kong et al. found increased Bacteroidetes and decreased Firmicutes levels in a R6/1 transgenic mice model. In this study, dysbiosis was followed by body weight deterioration, gastrointestinal motility problems, and the loss of motor ability. Subsequent studies performed by the same group revealed the negative correlation between Blautia producta and butyrate production.

"In the past decade, single dietary factors which can positively manipulate the gut microbiota-brain axis through microbiome modulation have gained significant attention. One of these factors is probiotic bacteria and/or prebiotics. Probiotics are defined as microbial organisms with a beneficial role in the host's health and homeostasis, which help to preserve digestive, metabolic, immune, and neuroendocrine functions. Naturally probiotic bacteria can be found in fermented food. Experimental results revealed that the administration of probiotics alone or in combination with prebiotics (fructooligosaccharides or galactooligosaccharides) improved the gastrointestinal barrier, which is the first line of ""defence"" from harmful factors occurring in food, and the microbiome. Probiotics and prebiotics are well-documented ""problem-solution"" for gastrointestinal diseases. Moreover, probiotics can reduce CNS inflammatory processes and activation of microglia, demonstrating promising potential for use in neurodegenerative diseases as ingestible ""psychobiotics"". Many studies indicate that the ingestion of probiotics can serve as a microbiological strategy against neurodegenerative diseases such as AD; however, the exact mechanism is under investigation. Experiments performed on mice underline the hypothesis that mechanisms related to neuroprotective effects of Bifidobacterium breve administration may be connected with neuroinflammation and cognition pathways, probably through the production of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) neurotransmitter and the regulation of the gut microbial composition. Clinical results of a randomized double-blind controlled trial revealed that 3-month exposure to Lactobacillus spp. And a Bifidobacterium bifidum ""cocktail"" enhanced cognitive functions and memory, as examined in a mini-mental state test. It was demonstrated that Bifidobacterium breve exerts positive and unique activity in AD patients, improving cognitive functions and reducing neuroinflammation.

"The gut microbiome is crucially engaged in the regulation and maintenance of human health and homeostasis, i.e., proper intestine motion, fibre digestion, regulating the development of host immunity, and exerting a protective effect against pathogenic factors (such as Campylobacter jejuni, Helicobacter pylori, and Clostridium difficile). The Irish ELDERMET study (Elderly to benefit from Research Project) demonstrated the correlation between intestinal microbiota diversity and health outcomes such as overall health, frailty, and proper immune functions, underlying the gut microbiota composition as a possible indicator of healthy ageing. Multiple studies showed the interplay between the intestinal microbiota and modulation of central nervous system (CNS) functions and neurodegeneration processes, pointing to the microbiome-gut-brain axis as one of the factors modulating host homeostasis in health and disease. In the past decade, the alterations of the gut microbiota, which are called dysbiosis, have been connected with the pathophysiology of numerous common diseases such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, gastrointestinal diseases, and cardiovascular events. Dysbiosis state is also implicated in neurological and neurodegenerative disorders such as autism, and Alzheimer's (AD) or Parkinson's (PD) diseases.

They are indispensable for maintaining the physiological function of adult tissues and organs by synthesizing a variety of vitamins, participating in food digestion, producing lactic acid, promoting intestinal peristalsis, inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microbiota, and activating the immune system. For example, one of the most important commensal microbes in the human gut is Bifidobacterium, a strictly anaerobic gram-positive bacterium, which assists the human body in the digestion and absorption of nutrients, resists the invasion of harmful bacteria, improves the immune function of the body, secretes molecules to regulate immune function, and participates in the metabolism of substances in the intestine. Besides, another common commensal microbe, A. muciniphila, a gram-positive bacterium, reduces insulin sensitivity and is inversely associated with the development of obesity and diabetes.

In mechanism, TMAO enhances platelet hyperreactivity by altering Ca2+ signaling and elicits a pro-thrombotic effect. Especially, TMAO seems to induce systemic inflammation that contributes to CAD progression. This is particularly relevant given that TMAO directly activates inflammatory pathways, and elicits perturbations in membrane dynamics in human aortic ECs and smooth muscle cells.

"Aromatic amino acids including tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine are metabolized into indole and phenols by certain intestinal anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, and Peptostreptococcus. Tryptophan is decomposed into indole, indoleacetic acid, indole-3-lactic acid, 3-methylindole (skatole) and other indole compounds under the action of tryptophanase. Tryptophanase is the key enzyme that generates indole. The activity of the enzyme is easily induced by the substrate tryptophan, so when the amount of tryptophan changes in the colonic environment, the content of indole will fluctuate greatly. Of note, the metabolic products of aromatic amino acids generated by gut microbiota have a great impact on the pathology of cardiometabolic diseases. For example, indole propionic acid is associated with insulin sensitivity and appears to reduce the risk of diabetes. Moreover, the gut microbiota metabolizes dietary tryptophan to indoxyl, which further generates indoxyl sulfate through sulfonation. Excessive accumulation of indoxyl sulfate causes cardiomyocyte damage and increases thrombus formation. Another phenol compound, 4-methylphenol, can inhibit the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into mature adipocytes, induce apoptosis and reduce glucose uptake. In addition, benzoic acid is an aromatic carboxylic acid synthesized by colonic microorganisms by metabolizing dietary aromatic compounds.

"The function of the gut microbiota is closely related to the risk of CVDs. Specifically, an impaired mucosal barrier, overactivated inflammation, and immune dysfunction are crucial steps in the development of CVDs triggered by gut microbiota dysbiosis. The structural constituents of gram-negative bacteria, such as LPS, are the main reason for endotoxemia and impaired intestinal mucosal barrier function. It has been reported that LPS is important in the development of cardiometabolic diseases. Moreover, studies showed that the high-fat diet could result in decreased intestinal levels of gram-positive Bifidobacteria and increased LPS-containing gut microbiota which further leads to obesity, the main risk factor for CVDs. Importantly, continuous subcutaneous infusion of LPS showed a tendency to cause the change of glucose metabolism and the pattern of weight gain was similar to that seen when taking a high-fat diet. Therefore, intestinal dysbiosis and the corresponding change in metabolites lead to abnormal nutrient metabolism, insulin resistance, and increased adipose tissue storage, which increases the risk of cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity and diabetes.

"The PD microbiome has a diminished variety of bacterial taxonomic groups, especially the ones associated with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects and the increase of phyla, which has toxic effects. Predominantly, the reduction was observed in the Lachnospiraceae family, including Butyrivibrio, Pseudobutyrivibrio, Coprococcus, Blautia and SCFAs-producing Prevotellaceae. The increased amount of Enterobacteriaceae is linked to the severity of postural instability and walking difficulties. Moreover, the PD microbiome is characterised by increased Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium species and decreased amount of Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae. The overgrowth of Akkermansia spp. in PD patients may be strain-specific and can be related to immune-response alterations, decreased mucus thicknesses, and increased constipation. Faecalibacterium family is a crucial player producing SCFAs and anti-inflammatory metabolites, maintaining gut health. Faecalibacterium balance disturbances can lead to impaired gut-barrier function, increasing the risk of infection with enteric pathogens and boosting alpha-synuclein formation. Similarly, the Lachnospiraceae family can produce butyrate, important for the proper function of the gut epithelium. Decreased Lachnospiraceae quantity might aggravate gut inflammation, stimulate toxin production, and damage the integrity of the gut epithelial barrier. PD patients' intestinal microflora were characterised by a diminished abundance of Lachnospiraceae, which was positively correlated with PD progress, cognitive decline, and impaired motor functions. These microbiome's compositional changes correlate well with some metabolic switches. PD microbiota show reduced SCFAs production, decreased carbohydrate fermentation, and augmented proteolytic fermentation. Chen et al. demonstrated that the SCFA level was relevant to microbiota composition changes and the clinical severity of PD. The levels of SCFAs acetate, butyrate, and propionate in fecal samples of PD patients were significantly reduced, contrary to their elevated concentration in plasma. Rodent models of PD disease have shown a positive effect of SCFAs on behavior and PD symptoms. Butyrate, as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, exerts neuroprotective activity, reducing dopaminergic cell death, and motor impairment, and improving cognitive functions.

A positive correlation between polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (N-3 PUFA), and alpha-linolenic acid (aLNA) ingestion and protection against PD development in dose-response trends was demonstrated. American studies demonstrated that PUFA replacement with increased animal fat intake (Western Diet) significantly increased the risk of PD in males only. Excessive animal fat intake can promote dysbiosis and the production of harmful microbial metabolites, which can increase the prevalence of the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, sex differences are implicated in the mental health and prevalence of psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, and neurodegenerative disorders.

"Scientific evidence indicates that the metabolic status of microbiota exerts a more important role than the equilibrium between bacterial species. Microbial metabolites can act as positive modulators of the gut-brain-axis constituents, boosting the immune cells and exerting a positive/protective effect on neurodegenerative disease progression. On the other hand, disrupted equilibrium between microbial species often leads to specific switches in the microbial metabolome, which may be harmful and associated with neurodegenerative disease progression. For example, dysregulation of Gram-negative bacteria in the gastrointestinal area leads to the production of harmful metabolites (i.e., endo- and exotoxins, saccharides, and amyloids). Exotoxins, such as LPS, which have the ability to activate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, exert negative effects. LPS belongs to glycolipid molecules, mostly produced by Gram-negative bacterial strains. These molecules participate in the integrity maintenance of the bacterial outer-membrane permeability barrier, playing an important role in host-pathogen interplay. The overproduction of bacterial LPS can cause the activation of the macrophage-monocyte nod-like receptor P3 inflammasome, therefore stimulating the production of cytokines with pro-inflammatory activity, such as IL-18 or IL-1beta. LPS can be translocated and intensify neuroinflammatory diseases such as AD.

"The PD microbiome has a diminished variety of bacterial taxonomic groups, especially the ones associated with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects and the increase of phyla, which has toxic effects. Predominantly, the reduction was observed in the Lachnospiraceae family, including Butyrivibrio, Pseudobutyrivibrio, Coprococcus, Blautia and SCFAs-producing Prevotellaceae. The increased amount of Enterobacteriaceae is linked to the severity of postural instability and walking difficulties. Moreover, the PD microbiome is characterised by increased Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium species and decreased amount of Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae. The overgrowth of Akkermansia spp. in PD patients may be strain-specific and can be related to immune-response alterations, decreased mucus thicknesses, and increased constipation. Faecalibacterium family is a crucial player producing SCFAs and anti-inflammatory metabolites, maintaining gut health. Faecalibacterium balance disturbances can lead to impaired gut-barrier function, increasing the risk of infection with enteric pathogens and boosting alpha-synuclein formation. Similarly, the Lachnospiraceae family can produce butyrate, important for the proper function of the gut epithelium. Decreased Lachnospiraceae quantity might aggravate gut inflammation, stimulate toxin production, and damage the integrity of the gut epithelial barrier. PD patients' intestinal microflora were characterised by a diminished abundance of Lachnospiraceae, which was positively correlated with PD progress, cognitive decline, and impaired motor functions. These microbiome's compositional changes correlate well with some metabolic switches.

"Mechanically, current studies suggest that SCFAs may exert their functions through acting as energy substrates and maintaining metabolic integration by a variety of different downstream regulatory mechanisms, such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPRs) with GPR41/Recombinant Free Fatty Acid Receptor (FFAR3), GPR43/FFAR2, GPR109A, Olfactory Receptors 78 (Olfr78) in endocrine cells of the gut wall, as well as histone deacetylases (HDACs) (Fig. 2).

"In the past decade, single dietary factors which can positively manipulate the gut microbiota-brain axis through microbiome modulation have gained significant attention. One of these factors is probiotic bacteria and/or prebiotics. Probiotics are defined as microbial organisms with a beneficial role in the host's health and homeostasis, which help to preserve digestive, metabolic, immune, and neuroendocrine functions. Naturally probiotic bacteria can be found in fermented food. Experimental results revealed that the administration of probiotics alone or in combination with prebiotics (fructooligosaccharides or galactooligosaccharides) improved the gastrointestinal barrier, which is the first line of ""defence"" from harmful factors occurring in food, and the microbiome. Probiotics and prebiotics are well-documented ""problem-solution"" for gastrointestinal diseases. Moreover, probiotics can reduce CNS inflammatory processes and activation of microglia, demonstrating promising potential for use in neurodegenerative diseases as ingestible ""psychobiotics"". Many studies indicate that the ingestion of probiotics can serve as a microbiological strategy against neurodegenerative diseases such as AD; however, the exact mechanism is under investigation. Experiments performed on mice underline the hypothesis that mechanisms related to neuroprotective effects of Bifidobacterium breve administration may be connected with neuroinflammation and cognition pathways, probably through the production of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) neurotransmitter and the regulation of the gut microbial composition. Clinical results of a randomized double-blind controlled trial revealed that 3-month exposure to Lactobacillus spp. And a Bifidobacterium bifidum ""cocktail"" enhanced cognitive functions and memory, as examined in a mini-mental state test.

Tryptophan is decomposed into indole, indoleacetic acid, indole-3-lactic acid, 3-methylindole (skatole) and other indole compounds under the action of tryptophanase. Tryptophanase is the key enzyme that generates indole.

For example, indole propionic acid is associated with insulin sensitivity and appears to reduce the risk of diabetes. Moreover, the gut microbiota metabolizes dietary tryptophan to indoxyl, which further generates indoxyl sulfate through sulfonation. Excessive accumulation of indoxyl sulfate causes cardiomyocyte damage and increases thrombus formation.

It was found that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota may lead to decreased cardiac function and increased cardiomyopathy as well as cardiac insufficiency, which is of great significance in predicting CVDs and also has important predictive significance for the prognosis of adverse cardiovascular events. The gut microbiota has been reported to be associated with CVDs and its corresponding risk factors, such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, and insulin resistance. These risk factors may affect the composition and the diversity of gut microbiota. In addition, gut dysbiosis is also linked to inflammation, oxidative stress, platelet activity, thrombosis and atherosclerosis, which contribute to the progression of CVDs. The possible mechanism of gut microbiota dysbiosis related to CVDs includes its role in increasing intestinal permeability and triggering inflammation via the LPS/TLR4 as well as NLRP3 pathways, thereby ultimately contributing to the development of CVDs. In short, the inflammation directly triggers by gut microbiota is one of the possible mechanisms of CVDs susceptibility, and material metabolism affected by gut microbiota was proposed to play a role as well.",17039945.0,y_vf9W66Y4,481,gut microbiota,440.0,454.0,Species,495.0,499.0,CVDs,Disease,Associated_with
"Alzheimer's disease (AD), commonly known as senile dementia, is a chronic, devastating, neurodegenerative, and neuroinflammatory disorder with rising incidence and is considered to be the most frequent form of dementia in aging individuals (caused by aberrant protein processing, trafficking, and aggregation in neural cells). The World Alzheimer Report indicates that 50 million people suffer from AD-related neurological problems and this number will increase to 152 million in 2050. It is predicted that in 2030 up to 66 million people will suffer from AD. AD is a multifactorial disease characterized by synapse loss, extracellular cerebral accumulation of insoluble peptides belonging to amyloid-beta (Abeta), the aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein inside the cells, neurofibrillary mass formation, neuronal death (in the neocortex and hippocampus), progressive memory deterioration, and cognition decline leading to dementia. AD is associated with more than 700 genetic and environmental risk factors. From the genetic point of view, one of the most important risk factors related to AD development is the incidence of a ""4 allele variant in the apolipoprotein"" (APOE4) gene, which is associated with cholesterol transport in CNS, and also contributes to metabolomic and taxonomic changes in the microbiome.",16422307.0,JQGUVVRpe_,392,insoluble peptides,661.0,679.0,Species,707.0,712.0,Abeta,Species,part_of

Bacteroidetes are detected in children genetically predisposed to type 1 diabetes (T1D). Regarding T2D, patients were characterized by a decrease in several butyrate-producing bacteria and an increase in many opportunistic pathogens. For example, patients with T2D have reduced Clostridium butyricum in the gut, a main butyrate-producing bacteria. Lower concentrations of butyrate producing microbiota have been observed in fecal samples of patients with T2D. Moreover, Lactobacillus is positively correlated with fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels, while Clostridium is negatively correlated with fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels. Patients with T2D have significantly higher levels of Lactobacillus in fecal samples than healthy individuals.

"Aromatic amino acids including tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine are metabolized into indole and phenols by certain intestinal anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, and Peptostreptococcus. Tryptophan is decomposed into indole, indoleacetic acid, indole-3-lactic acid, 3-methylindole (skatole) and other indole compounds under the action of tryptophanase. Tryptophanase is the key enzyme that generates indole. The activity of the enzyme is easily induced by the substrate tryptophan, so when the amount of tryptophan changes in the colonic environment, the content of indole will fluctuate greatly. Of note, the metabolic products of aromatic amino acids generated by gut microbiota have a great impact on the pathology of cardiometabolic diseases. For example, indole propionic acid is associated with insulin sensitivity and appears to reduce the risk of diabetes. Moreover, the gut microbiota metabolizes dietary tryptophan to indoxyl, which further generates indoxyl sulfate through sulfonation. Excessive accumulation of indoxyl sulfate causes cardiomyocyte damage and increases thrombus formation. Another phenol compound, 4-methylphenol, can inhibit the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into mature adipocytes, induce apoptosis and reduce glucose uptake. In addition, benzoic acid is an aromatic carboxylic acid synthesized by colonic microorganisms by metabolizing dietary aromatic compounds.

"In addition, phosphatidylcholine can be hydrolyzed into choline in the intestine in vivo, and the gut microbiota can convert choline into trimethylamine (TMA). After being absorbed by the intestinal tract, TMA is further transported to the liver and oxidized into TMAO by liver flavin monooxygenase 3 (FMO3), which plays an important role in human health and CVDs. TMAO also reduces reverse cholesterol transportation, and changes BAs composition. Some studies genetically manipulated hepatic FMO3 to modulate lipid homeostasis, suggesting a major role of gut microbiota in lipid metabolism. Furthermore, changes in TMAO levels have been found in metabolic diseases such as fatty liver and hyperlipidemia, suggesting that lipid metabolism mediated by gut microbiota plays an important role in the occurrence and development of diseases.",17118299.0,923,tF0K0kxr5o,flavin monooxygenase 3,278.0,300.0,Species,206.0,209.0,TMA,Chemical,Interacts_with

Various animal and human studies suggested the participation of gut microbiota in the development of MS. Animal studies on an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mice model revealed a significant reduction in Lactobacillus phyla, contributing to an impairment of the mice's immune systems. In patients diagnosed with MS, a reduction in the variety and quantity of gut bacteria was detected, confirming a moderate dysbiosis state.

"Recently, bacterial strains producing SCFAs have gained extreme popularity. SCFAs are small organic monocarboxylic acids, released after the fermentation of indigestible alimentary fiber (mainly galacto- or fructooligosaccharides), plant-derived polysaccharides, or the metabolism of amino acids, and are considered a key gut-derived metabolites with beneficial health effects and as essential in gut-brain crosstalk. The type of formed SCFAs is correlated with the kind of fiber ingested and the overall gut microbiota population. For example, microbes belonging to Firmicutes phyla (e.g., Lachnospiraceae, Eubacterium, or Roseburia belonging to the Clostridia class) are responsible for the main production of butyrate, whereas Bifidobacteria spp. produce lactate and acetate. SCFAs are significantly reduced during dysbiosis, where disrupted gut epithelial integrity, inflammation, and altered microbiome metabolic processes occur. In a healthy colon, levels of SCFAs can vary depending on a diet; however, in multiple diseases, these levels are altered. SCFAs may also act in an indirect or direct way through G-protein-coupled receptors or as histone deacetylase epigenetic modulators. They participate in various physiological processes, such as cell energetics and colonocyte metabolism and skeletal, adipose, and liver tissue modulation. Their major functions comprise the activation of trophic factors, energy management, and the manufacturing of regulatory T-cells.

They are harmless under physical conditions, and have a potential pathogenic influence on the host following changes in the environment.

"At the end of this chapter, it is worth mentioning the fact that the interaction between the microbiome and the host is bidirectional, and some metabolic changes, which could be a pathological result of disease progression, also influence microbiome metabolism. A good example is a disturbance in cholesterol homeostasis, which correlates with an augmented probability of Alzheimer's disease occurrence. In addition, alteration of the intestinal microbiota composition with the subsequent fluctuations in the serum and brain levels of bile acids (BAs) is involved in the development of AD. BAs can act as detergents, affecting BBB permeability, and incrementing brain influx of peripheral cholesterol and BAs. Therefore, proper cholesterol elimination pathways play a crucial role in AD prevention and treatment. The gut microbiome is a main ""organ"" metabolizing secondary bile acids. Peripheral cholesterol is eliminated mainly through its liver conversion to BAs. The gut microbiota performs BA transformation via deconjugation and dehydroxylation, leading to secondary BA formation. Nho et al. investigated the correlation between neurodegeneration and BAs, B-amyloid, and tau protein concentration. The application of targeted metabolomics enabled the determination of the association between intestinal microbiota-derived secondary bile acids and sera BAs. Interestingly, the analysis indicated an imbalanced BA ratio, underlying an increased amount of secondary BAs over primary ones. Another clinical study confirmed the correlation between bile acid metabolic profile and the prevalence of AD and mild cognitive impairment, showing similar BA ratio disruptions. Decreased cognitive functions were positively associated with increased concentrations of secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid, and glycolithocholic acid.

"SCFAs may prevent obesity by regulating the homeostasis of glucose and lipid metabolism. For instance, acetate decreases appetite and nutrient intake. Propionate activates intestinal gluconeogenesis by a gut-brain neural circuit to promote energy balance. Butyrate provides energy for colon cells, maintains the integrity of intestinal walls, and improves the insulin response, which activates gluconeogenesis to maintain the balance of glucose and energy through the cAMP pathway. And one study indicated that oral butyrate intake prevents obesity and insulin resistance. Furthermore, the role of SCFAs in metabolic hemostasis is related to other factors. Adenosine monophosphate activating protein (AMPK) is a heterotrimeric enzyme that stimulates liver and muscle fatty acid oxidation pathways. SCFAs promote the activity of AMPK and improve its ability to oxidize fatty acids. Last, SCFAs can affect the development of dyslipidemia. SCFAs increase the expression of fasting-induced adipose factor (FIAF), a circulating lipoprotein lipase inhibitor, by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-gamma), thereby decreasing the activity of lipoproteinases and inhibiting lipolysis in adipose tissues.

"It remains unclear how the gut microbiota and BAs profiles interact with each other and whether the interaction is associated with obesity. Mice fed BAs exhibited obesity and a composition change in the obesity-associated gut microbiota, which is similar to high-fat diet-fed mice. Under a high-fat diet, the concentration of intestinal BAs increases, and the composition of gut microbiota alternates. For example, the increased BAs are the main reason for the marked increase in the abundance of the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. Another study has shown that BAs and a high-fat diet promote the growth of Bilophila wadsworthia in mice, and secondary BAs produced by Bilophila spp. have been shown to induce obesity. What's more, it has been reported that the low capacity of microbiota to metabolize Tauro-beta-muricholic acid, a primary BA, might increase the risk of obesity and insulin resistance.

"The origins of Parkinson's disease are the result of many factors such as increased age, polygenic factors (disease-segregating mutations in alpha-synuclein protein occurring in 15% of PD patients), toxins, and infectious agents. In 2006, Braak et al. assumed the gut-related origins of Parkinson's disease. One of the key pathological hallmarks of PD is Lewy bodies, being eosinophilic inclusion forms of misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates. Importantly, alpha-synuclein protein has a tendency to misfold and form aggregates. Its accumulation has been detected during bacterial and viral infections in the gut. Moreover, it can be recognized as a characteristic indicator of PD neural degeneration. This protein aggregate can boost the local immune response. Interestingly, alpha-synuclein deposition has been confirmed in the neurons of the intestinal submucosa, together with a possibility of the alpha-synuclein transport to the brain via the vagus nerve (translocation of prion-like proteins). Misfolded alpha-synuclein triggers neuronal dysfunction and progressive degeneration, thereby enabling disease progression.

"Recent studies underlined the important role of the gut microbiota in bidirectional crosstalk in Huntington's disease (HD). Huntington's disease has genetic origins related to trinucleotide expansion (CAG) in the huntingtin coding gene. Moreover, experiments performed in mice models revealed that the altered microbiota observed in the HD-suffering individuals at the pre-motor symptomatic stage highly influence health status. HD microbiota composition indicated dysbiosis, disturbances in cytokine levels, and an increase in sulphur metabolism characterized by hydrogen sulphide overproduction and negatively influencing gut health. Ultimately, the gut dysbiosis state was also described in a transgenic mice model representing Huntington's disease. Kong et al. found increased Bacteroidetes and decreased Firmicutes levels in a R6/1 transgenic mice model. In this study, dysbiosis was followed by body weight deterioration, gastrointestinal motility problems, and the loss of motor ability. Subsequent studies performed by the same group revealed the negative correlation between Blautia producta and butyrate production.

"In summary, the gut microbiota generates a series of bioactive metabolites to interact with host metabolism. These metabolites mainly include SCFAs, primary and secondary BAs, TMAO, and so on. Among these metabolites, some exert synergistic effects to promote host health by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system to control glucose metabolism. For example, SCFAs interact with human hormones such as GLP-1 and PYY to effect energy uptake and the development of obesity. SCFAs are beneficial for regulating appetite and energy intake, and preventing the formation of atherosclerosis. Other metabolites, such as TMAO and phenylacetylglutamine (PAGln), may be toxic. For example, TMAO may be proatherogenic to promote the process of thrombosis and atherosclerosis, thereby increasing the risk of cardiovascular events. Patients with CVDs had lower levels of SCFA generation and higher levels of TMAO production due to the change in gut microbiota. Furthermore, TMAO causes vascular endothelial damage and promotes the production of atherosclerotic plaques. TMAO can also increase the release of intracellular calcium ions, enhance the reactivity of platelets, and increase the risk of thrombosis to increase CVDs susceptibility. Besides, PAGln enhances platelet reactivity and thrombosis, leading to CVDs.

In patients with CVDs and corresponding risk factors, the composition and ratio of gut microbiota have significant differences compared with their healthy counterparts. Therefore, gut microbiota dysbiosis, gut microbiota-generated metabolites, and the related signaling pathway may serve as explanations for some of the mechanisms about the occurrence and development of CVDs.

"The mechanism by which BCAAs induce insulin resistance is still not fully understood. The rise of BCAA levels is found to regulate glycolipid metabolism, cause insulin resistance, and increase the risk of T2D. Other animal experiments have shown that elevated BCAAs are transferred to skeletal muscle, and are interfered with lipid metabolism, which causes the accumulation of lipid metabolites and ultimately leads to skeletal muscle insulin resistance. Additionally, BCAAs are the key regulatory factor of mTORC1. It activates mTORC1 and ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (S6K1) by inducing the phosphorylation of IRS1, blocking the insulin signaling pathway, and eventually causing insulin resistance. However, 2 other studies have shown that BCAAs may exert their functions without mTORC1. One study reported that the metabolites of BCAAs, 3-hydroxy isobutyrate, could cause insulin resistance by promoting skeletal muscle sprouting. Another study reported that a diet rich in BCAAs can cause overeating, obesity, and shortened lifespan, which was not related to the mTOR signaling pathway in the liver but is mainly due to hyperphagia.",18449544.0,2349,_g2eGz4M6q,BCAAs,747.0,752.0,Chemical,160.0,178.0,insulin resistance,Disease,None

"Given that the gut microbiota is essential in human health, changes in the composition and function of the gut microbiota may result in the development of diseases. Due to the influence of host genes, diet, antibiotic use, lifestyle, drugs as well as other factors, the composition and diversity of gut microbiota gradually change with interindividual variation. For example, a high-fat diet leads to an increase in the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. When the composition and proportion of gut microbiota change, inflammation and metabolic abnormalities can be induced, which contribute to the development of different diseases. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota refers to changes in the number, species and composition of gut microbiota. In recent years, gut microbiota dysbiosis has been shown to be critically involved in health and has emerged as a potential pathogenesis for various diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, cancers, and CVDs. Moreover, gut dysbiosis is also a driver of metabolic inflammation and metabolic dysregulation, which serve as a key feature of metabolic diseases. For instance, the translocation of intestinal bacteria to the blood and liver through the portal venous system together with its metabolites are able to stimulate the release of inflammatory factors, and promote the occurrence of non-alcoholic fatty liver as well as hepatitis. Moreover, it has been reported that the gut microbiota also plays an important role in CVDs, which has aroused our great interest.",16619753.0,179,178,Dysbiosis,633.0,642.0,Disease,534.0,557.0,metabolic abnormalities,Disease,causes
"The health of the gut microbiome can vary depending on various factors including diet (e.g., ingestion of saturated/unsaturated dietary fats, vitamins, minerals, dairy products, alcoholic beverages, polyphenols containing food such as cocoa-rich chocolate, tea, or coffee), dietary patterns, geographical area, and diet-related habits (sometimes varying between males and females) and sex (the influence of sex hormones). A positive correlation between polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (N-3 PUFA), and alpha-linolenic acid (aLNA) ingestion and protection against PD development in dose-response trends was demonstrated. American studies demonstrated that PUFA replacement with increased animal fat intake (Western Diet) significantly increased the risk of PD in males only. Excessive animal fat intake can promote dysbiosis and the production of harmful microbial metabolites, which can increase the prevalence of the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, sex differences are implicated in the mental health and prevalence of psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, and neurodegenerative disorders. It has been demonstrated that PD patients usually have altered microbiome compositions compared with controls. Similar to AD, many sex differences in PD are correlated with the protective nature of estrogens, as they are impacted by the gut-brain axis and protect against oxidative damage, thereby supporting dopaminergic function. It has been demonstrated that at age 45, the estimated overall lifetime risk for AD is about 20% for females and 10% for males, which is followed by a disruption in the patient's gut microbiota composition. In summary, it is worth underlining the correlation between the gut microbiome, immune system and brain, mental health, and behavior.",16221004.0,c-VgKmQi8p,1848,estrogens,1344.0,1353.0,Chemical,1296.0,1298.0,PD,Disease,improve

"SCFAs may prevent obesity by regulating the homeostasis of glucose and lipid metabolism. For instance, acetate decreases appetite and nutrient intake. Propionate activates intestinal gluconeogenesis by a gut-brain neural circuit to promote energy balance. Butyrate provides energy for colon cells, maintains the integrity of intestinal walls, and improves the insulin response, which activates gluconeogenesis to maintain the balance of glucose and energy through the cAMP pathway. And one study indicated that oral butyrate intake prevents obesity and insulin resistance. Furthermore, the role of SCFAs in metabolic hemostasis is related to other factors. Adenosine monophosphate activating protein (AMPK) is a heterotrimeric enzyme that stimulates liver and muscle fatty acid oxidation pathways. SCFAs promote the activity of AMPK and improve its ability to oxidize fatty acids. Last, SCFAs can affect the development of dyslipidemia. SCFAs increase the expression of fasting-induced adipose factor (FIAF), a circulating lipoprotein lipase inhibitor, by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-gamma), thereby decreasing the activity of lipoproteinases and inhibiting lipolysis in adipose tissues.

TMAO is produced from dietary phosphatidylcholine by the intestinal microbiota. Preclinical models of cerebral ischemia indicate the coexistence of pathological microflora which negatively affect intestinal permeability and motility. Some reported experimental results indicate the relationship of intestinal microbiota with neuroinflammatory processes by modulating intestinal T-cell trafficking to the CNS.

"Importantly, studies found that the occurrence of CVDs was also involved in the immune response mediated by the NLR family. For example, atherosclerotic plaques in LDLR-/- NOD 1/2-/- mice showed less lipid deposition and macrophage aggregation, suggesting that lack of NOD 1/2 may reduce the occurrence of atherosclerosis. Moreover, the peptidoglycan components in bacteria can bind to NOD1 and NOD2, which in turn mediate the occurrence of the inflammatory response, and further leads to atherosclerosis. Besides, inflammation induced by the NLRP3 inflammasome plays a role in the interaction between gut microbiota and cardiometabolic diseases. For instance, the NLRP3 deficient obese mice had altered composition of the gut microbiota, decreased TMAO and LPS levels, as well as downregulated hepatic steatosis and myocardial energy metabolism. Nevertheless, another study reported that NOD TLR4 -/- mice developed higher body weight, hyperlipidemia, severe insulin, and glucose intolerance, lower circulating SCFAs levels, higher levels of Bacteroidetes, lower levels of Firmicutes in the large intestine, as well as fewer SCFAs-associated gut microbiota, all of which may promote the development of insulin-deficient diabetes.",16855003.0,390,376,NLRP3,543.0,548.0,Gene,515.0,527.0,inflammation,Disease,start

Furthermore, the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota triggers intestinal mucosal barrier damage, leading to inflammation and disordered nutrient metabolism.

In mechanism, TMAO enhances platelet hyperreactivity by altering Ca2+ signaling and elicits a pro-thrombotic effect. Especially, TMAO seems to induce systemic inflammation that contributes to CAD progression. This is particularly relevant given that TMAO directly activates inflammatory pathways, and elicits perturbations in membrane dynamics in human aortic ECs and smooth muscle cells.

"BAs, as by-products of cholesterol metabolism, are the main organic component of bile and are synthesized in hepatocytes. Cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) are primary BAs directly synthesized from cholesterol; secondary BAs include deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholic acid (LCA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and their glycine and taurine conjugated forms. BAs are excreted into the intestine to aid in the digestion and absorption of lipids and combine with farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and takeda-G-protein receptor 5 (TGR5) (Fig. 2). There is a strong biochemical relationship between BAs and gut microbiota. Some gut microbiota in healthy people can convert conjugated BAs into free BAs, and can transform BAs into secondary BAs with the help of bile salt hydrolase (BSH) and cholesterol 7-alpha hydroxy-lase (CYP7A1), so as to reduce blood cholesterol by affecting the enterohepatic circulation of BAs. Besides, the gut microbiota affects the metabolism of BAs by regulating the activity of BSH to reduce LDL cholesterol levels. BAs have bacteriostatic properties and an antimicrobial effect. BAs destroy the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane and thereby change the intestinal microecology. BAs also prevent bacteria from overgrowth and decrease inflammation. More importantly, BAs are also closely associated with CVDs. For example, BAs levels in the feces of patients with CVDs are different from those in healthy individuals. And BAs have been reported to regulate vascular tension and affect ion exchange on cardiomyocyte membranes, suggesting that regulating BAs by gut microbiota might be a treatment for CVDs.",17301489.0,QgBTqFar1f,874,BAs,1304.0,1307.0,Chemical,1341.0,1345.0,CVDs,Disease,Associated_with

"Previous results have indicated that the metabolic regulation of BAs may be associated with T2D but the specific changes in BAs and the related mechanisms remain to be studied. It is also unclear how the different types of BAs change in patients with T2D. A study also suggested that patients with T2D had no change in plasma total BAs, but had an increase in DCA and a decrease in CDCA in plasma. Another study found that the plasma total BA concentration in patients with T2D was not significantly different from that of healthy people; however, the concentration of DCA in the plasma of patients with T2D was significantly higher than that of healthy controls. The mechanism may be that FXR and TGR5 are inhibited during insulin resistance, and the most effective natural ligands of the receptors, DCA and CA, are compensatorily increased. Besides, circulating BAs levels including DCA, TCA, TDCA, and glycodeoxycholic acid, are positively associated with the risk of T2D, while taurohyodeoxycholic acid is negatively associated with diabetes. This may be due to the fact that hydrophobic BAs isoforms (such as DCA) have been shown to be involved in inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress with glucose dysregulation, and hydrophilic BAs isoforms (such as tauroursodeoxycholic acid) have been shown to prevent inflammation and enhance insulin sensitivity.",18340523.0,2041,-13vl2EqoP,patients,460.0,468.0,Species,474.0,477.0,T2D,Disease,experiences
"The PD microbiome has a diminished variety of bacterial taxonomic groups, especially the ones associated with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects and the increase of phyla, which has toxic effects. Predominantly, the reduction was observed in the Lachnospiraceae family, including Butyrivibrio, Pseudobutyrivibrio, Coprococcus, Blautia and SCFAs-producing Prevotellaceae. The increased amount of Enterobacteriaceae is linked to the severity of postural instability and walking difficulties. Moreover, the PD microbiome is characterised by increased Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium species and decreased amount of Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae. The overgrowth of Akkermansia spp. in PD patients may be strain-specific and can be related to immune-response alterations, decreased mucus thicknesses, and increased constipation. Faecalibacterium family is a crucial player producing SCFAs and anti-inflammatory metabolites, maintaining gut health. Faecalibacterium balance disturbances can lead to impaired gut-barrier function, increasing the risk of infection with enteric pathogens and boosting alpha-synuclein formation. Similarly, the Lachnospiraceae family can produce butyrate, important for the proper function of the gut epithelium.

"Recently, bacterial strains producing SCFAs have gained extreme popularity. SCFAs are small organic monocarboxylic acids, released after the fermentation of indigestible alimentary fiber (mainly galacto- or fructooligosaccharides), plant-derived polysaccharides, or the metabolism of amino acids, and are considered a key gut-derived metabolites with beneficial health effects and as essential in gut-brain crosstalk. The type of formed SCFAs is correlated with the kind of fiber ingested and the overall gut microbiota population. For example, microbes belonging to Firmicutes phyla (e.g., Lachnospiraceae, Eubacterium, or Roseburia belonging to the Clostridia class) are responsible for the main production of butyrate, whereas Bifidobacteria spp. produce lactate and acetate.

"The function of the gut microbiota is closely related to the risk of CVDs. Specifically, an impaired mucosal barrier, overactivated inflammation, and immune dysfunction are crucial steps in the development of CVDs triggered by gut microbiota dysbiosis. The structural constituents of gram-negative bacteria, such as LPS, are the main reason for endotoxemia and impaired intestinal mucosal barrier function. It has been reported that LPS is important in the development of cardiometabolic diseases. Moreover, studies showed that the high-fat diet could result in decreased intestinal levels of gram-positive Bifidobacteria and increased LPS-containing gut microbiota which further leads to obesity, the main risk factor for CVDs. Importantly, continuous subcutaneous infusion of LPS showed a tendency to cause the change of glucose metabolism and the pattern of weight gain was similar to that seen when taking a high-fat diet. Therefore, intestinal dysbiosis and the corresponding change in metabolites lead to abnormal nutrient metabolism, insulin resistance, and increased adipose tissue storage, which increases the risk of cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity and diabetes.

"Mounting evidence has shown that patients with obesity have a change in the composition of the gut microbiota. In obesity, the increased gut microbiome included the phylum Molluskum of Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, as well as Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes ratios; the decreased gut microbiome included Akkermansia, Faecalibacterium, Oscillibacter, and Alistipes. More importantly, studies indicated that some types of microbes could be regarded as biomarkers for metabolism-related CVDs. For example, it has been reported that Dorea formicigenerans, Dorea longicatena and Collinsella aerofaciens are associated with obesity, and Lachnospiraceae is associated with lipid cardiovascular risk factors. Besides, Anaeroplasma and Haemophilus are negatively associated with cholesterol and triglycerides and positively associated with HDL.

"Scientific evidence indicates that the metabolic status of microbiota exerts a more important role than the equilibrium between bacterial species. Microbial metabolites can act as positive modulators of the gut-brain-axis constituents, boosting the immune cells and exerting a positive/protective effect on neurodegenerative disease progression. On the other hand, disrupted equilibrium between microbial species often leads to specific switches in the microbial metabolome, which may be harmful and associated with neurodegenerative disease progression. For example, dysregulation of Gram-negative bacteria in the gastrointestinal area leads to the production of harmful metabolites (i.e., endo- and exotoxins, saccharides, and amyloids). Exotoxins, such as LPS, which have the ability to activate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, exert negative effects. LPS belongs to glycolipid molecules, mostly produced by Gram-negative bacterial strains. These molecules participate in the integrity maintenance of the bacterial outer-membrane permeability barrier, playing an important role in host-pathogen interplay. The overproduction of bacterial LPS can cause the activation of the macrophage-monocyte nod-like receptor P3 inflammasome, therefore stimulating the production of cytokines with pro-inflammatory activity, such as IL-18 or IL-1beta. LPS can be translocated and intensify neuroinflammatory diseases such as AD. Additionally, it was demonstrated that IL-1beta can decrease the phagocytic function of microglial cells, stimulating the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, and causing reduced synaptic plasticity and cognitive deterioration. These cytokines can induce microbiota dysregulation, increasing gut permeability and influencing gut bacteria diversity.",16508033.0,HV5vHZpSRR,PB7E0T4J9a,gastrointestinal area,615.0,636.0,Cellline,585.0,607.0,Gram-negative bacteria,Species,Location_of

"Recent studies underlined the important role of the gut microbiota in bidirectional crosstalk in Huntington's disease (HD). Huntington's disease has genetic origins related to trinucleotide expansion (CAG) in the huntingtin coding gene. Moreover, experiments performed in mice models revealed that the altered microbiota observed in the HD-suffering individuals at the pre-motor symptomatic stage highly influence health status. HD microbiota composition indicated dysbiosis, disturbances in cytokine levels, and an increase in sulphur metabolism characterized by hydrogen sulphide overproduction and negatively influencing gut health. Ultimately, the gut dysbiosis state was also described in a transgenic mice model representing Huntington's disease. Kong et al. found increased Bacteroidetes and decreased Firmicutes levels in a R6/1 transgenic mice model. In this study, dysbiosis was followed by body weight deterioration, gastrointestinal motility problems, and the loss of motor ability. Subsequent studies performed by the same group revealed the negative correlation between Blautia producta and butyrate production. Moreover, Prevotella scopos was negatively associated with ATP levels. Clinical trials performed on patients suffering from Huntington's disease revealed the prevalence of bacterial phyla belonging to Firmicutes (83%), Actinobacteria (9%), Bacteroidetes (4%), and Verrucomicrobia (1.1%) detected in the collected fecal samples. The results of performed human randomized clinical trials positively correlate with the data obtained in mouse models in which gut microbiota dysbiosis was observed.

One study indicated that three BCAAs (leucine, isoleucine, and valine), and two aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine and tyrosine) were significantly increased 10 years before the onset of diabetes. The increased BCAAs-induced insulin resistance was associated with the presence of Prevotella copri and Bacteroides vulgatus. The major groups of gut bacteria that biosynthesize BCAAs are Prevotella copri and Bacteroides vulgatus, and the insulin resistance caused by elevated BCAAs levels is associated with the presence of these two bacteria.

"In fact, changes in the function of gut microecology and gut microbiota may cause the occurrence and exacerbation of various diseases. It was found that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota may lead to decreased cardiac function and increased cardiomyopathy as well as cardiac insufficiency, which is of great significance in predicting CVDs and also has important predictive significance for the prognosis of adverse cardiovascular events. The gut microbiota has been reported to be associated with CVDs and its corresponding risk factors, such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, and insulin resistance. These risk factors may affect the composition and the diversity of gut microbiota. In addition, gut dysbiosis is also linked to inflammation, oxidative stress, platelet activity, thrombosis and atherosclerosis, which contribute to the progression of CVDs. The possible mechanism of gut microbiota dysbiosis related to CVDs includes its role in increasing intestinal permeability and triggering inflammation via the LPS/TLR4 as well as NLRP3 pathways, thereby ultimately contributing to the development of CVDs. In short, the inflammation directly triggers by gut microbiota is one of the possible mechanisms of CVDs susceptibility, and material metabolism affected by gut microbiota was proposed to play a role as well.",17039945.0,y_vf9W66Y4,OsbvipkLpu,gut microbiota,440.0,454.0,Species,576.0,594.0,insulin resistance,Disease,Associated_with

"Experimental research confirms the hypothesis regarding SCFA reduction in autoimmune diseases (MS among others) and altered gut microbiota. A low level of SCFAs dysregulates Treg cell functions, leading to insufficient immune tolerance towards endogenous components and enteric microbiota. However, this process can be reversed by SCFAs supplementation (e.g., propionic acid). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing NFkappaB activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation and on microglial cells in vitro. TUDCA binds to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) expressed in microglial cells. This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS). Experimental results demonstrated that TUDCA acted as a double-edged sword, triggering microglia enhancement in anti-inflammatory and alternatively activated markers and on the other hand reducing the infiltration of macrophages and microglia with expressed pro-inflammatory markers. Interestingly, during neuroinflammation, microglial cells change their morphology, converting themselves into reactive macrophage-like forms. However, microglial cells are flexible, as they can sometimes polarize towards alternatively activated phenotypes, promoting CNS pathologies (proinflammatory or M1 microglia), or exert anti-inflammatory effects, boosting cell repair and remodeling. Bile acids were identified as nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor agonists, leading to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) depletion (in a mouse model) and neuroinflammatory process adjustment. The administration of the complex probiotic positively influenced the intestinal flora balance in patients diagnosed with MS. The probiotic prevented the onset of dysbiosis, significantly increasing the amount of Methanobrevibacter and Akkermansia, Prevotella, and Sutterella in MS patients, influencing gene expression and the production of beneficial bacterial metabolites.",16224291.0,-fD-BdANaE,1296,probiotic,2612.0,2621.0,Species,2747.0,2757.0,Sutterella,Species,increase

"The health of the gut microbiome can vary depending on various factors including diet (e.g., ingestion of saturated/unsaturated dietary fats, vitamins, minerals, dairy products, alcoholic beverages, polyphenols containing food such as cocoa-rich chocolate, tea, or coffee), dietary patterns, geographical area, and diet-related habits (sometimes varying between males and females) and sex (the influence of sex hormones). A positive correlation between polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (N-3 PUFA), and alpha-linolenic acid (aLNA) ingestion and protection against PD development in dose-response trends was demonstrated. American studies demonstrated that PUFA replacement with increased animal fat intake (Western Diet) significantly increased the risk of PD in males only. Excessive animal fat intake can promote dysbiosis and the production of harmful microbial metabolites, which can increase the prevalence of the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, sex differences are implicated in the mental health and prevalence of psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, and neurodegenerative disorders. It has been demonstrated that PD patients usually have altered microbiome compositions compared with controls. Similar to AD, many sex differences in PD are correlated with the protective nature of estrogens, as they are impacted by the gut-brain axis and protect against oxidative damage, thereby supporting dopaminergic function. It has been demonstrated that at age 45, the estimated overall lifetime risk for AD is about 20% for females and 10% for males, which is followed by a disruption in the patient's gut microbiota composition.

"Aromatic amino acids including tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine are metabolized into indole and phenols by certain intestinal anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, and Peptostreptococcus. Tryptophan is decomposed into indole, indoleacetic acid, indole-3-lactic acid, 3-methylindole (skatole) and other indole compounds under the action of tryptophanase. Tryptophanase is the key enzyme that generates indole. The activity of the enzyme is easily induced by the substrate tryptophan, so when the amount of tryptophan changes in the colonic environment, the content of indole will fluctuate greatly. Of note, the metabolic products of aromatic amino acids generated by gut microbiota have a great impact on the pathology of cardiometabolic diseases. For example, indole propionic acid is associated with insulin sensitivity and appears to reduce the risk of diabetes. Moreover, the gut microbiota metabolizes dietary tryptophan to indoxyl, which further generates indoxyl sulfate through sulfonation. Excessive accumulation of indoxyl sulfate causes cardiomyocyte damage and increases thrombus formation. Another phenol compound, 4-methylphenol, can inhibit the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into mature adipocytes, induce apoptosis and reduce glucose uptake.

Another study found that the plasma total BA concentration in patients with T2D was not significantly different from that of healthy people; however, the concentration of DCA in the plasma of patients with T2D was significantly higher than that of healthy controls.

Besides, circulating BAs levels including DCA, TCA, TDCA, and glycodeoxycholic acid, are positively associated with the risk of T2D, while taurohyodeoxycholic acid is negatively associated with diabetes.

"At the end of this chapter, it is worth mentioning the fact that the interaction between the microbiome and the host is bidirectional, and some metabolic changes, which could be a pathological result of disease progression, also influence microbiome metabolism. A good example is a disturbance in cholesterol homeostasis, which correlates with an augmented probability of Alzheimer's disease occurrence. In addition, alteration of the intestinal microbiota composition with the subsequent fluctuations in the serum and brain levels of bile acids (BAs) is involved in the development of AD. BAs can act as detergents, affecting BBB permeability, and incrementing brain influx of peripheral cholesterol and BAs. Therefore, proper cholesterol elimination pathways play a crucial role in AD prevention and treatment. The gut microbiome is a main ""organ"" metabolizing secondary bile acids. Peripheral cholesterol is eliminated mainly through its liver conversion to BAs. The gut microbiota performs BA transformation via deconjugation and dehydroxylation, leading to secondary BA formation. Nho et al. investigated the correlation between neurodegeneration and BAs, B-amyloid, and tau protein concentration. The application of targeted metabolomics enabled the determination of the association between intestinal microbiota-derived secondary bile acids and sera BAs. Interestingly, the analysis indicated an imbalanced BA ratio, underlying an increased amount of secondary BAs over primary ones. Another clinical study confirmed the correlation between bile acid metabolic profile and the prevalence of AD and mild cognitive impairment, showing similar BA ratio disruptions. Decreased cognitive functions were positively associated with increased concentrations of secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid, and glycolithocholic acid.

Screening tests identified the connection between Escherichia and Shigella bacterial species and increased systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine-related processes, reported in patients with Alzheimer's. Increased inflammatory processes and oxidative stress conditions can trigger neurodegeneration observed in people with Alzheimer's disease. The previously mentioned species belong to Gram-negative bacteria, which are capable of producing huge amounts of pro-inflammatory lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), thereby causing intestinal inflammation and gut barrier disruption. Increased gut permeability permits the transport and the systemic and brain accumulation of LPS or other bacterial toxins and the propagation of an inflammatory state.

"At present, it is generally believed that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota is an important factor affecting the integrity of the intestinal barrier. Previous studies showed that the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota could lead to the rapid proliferation of intestinal pathogenic bacteria, and the pro-inflammatory factors released by them seriously damaged the structure and function of the intestinal barrier, and it also promoted the occurrence and development of diseases in the digestive system as well as metabolic system. Furthermore, the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota triggers intestinal mucosal barrier damage, leading to inflammation and disordered nutrient metabolism. Overactivated inflammation caused by microbiota dysbiosis disrupts normal intestinal mucosal barrier function, and increases intestinal permeability to promote bacterial translocation, leading to endotoxemia and inflammation, thereby increasing the risk of CVDs.",16622110.0,mPr80VVBfO,amyScP9VVk,pro-inflammatory factors,294.0,318.0,Chemical,388.0,406.0,intestinal barrier,Cellline,worsen

"The origins of Parkinson's disease are the result of many factors such as increased age, polygenic factors (disease-segregating mutations in alpha-synuclein protein occurring in 15% of PD patients), toxins, and infectious agents. In 2006, Braak et al. assumed the gut-related origins of Parkinson's disease. One of the key pathological hallmarks of PD is Lewy bodies, being eosinophilic inclusion forms of misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates. Importantly, alpha-synuclein protein has a tendency to misfold and form aggregates. Its accumulation has been detected during bacterial and viral infections in the gut. Moreover, it can be recognized as a characteristic indicator of PD neural degeneration. This protein aggregate can boost the local immune response. Interestingly, alpha-synuclein deposition has been confirmed in the neurons of the intestinal submucosa, together with a possibility of the alpha-synuclein transport to the brain via the vagus nerve (translocation of prion-like proteins). Misfolded alpha-synuclein triggers neuronal dysfunction and progressive degeneration, thereby enabling disease progression. Additionally, alpha-synuclein deposition in CNS is associated with intestinal hyperpermeability, TLRs, and pro-inflammatory cytokine overexpression.

"The health of the gut microbiome can vary depending on various factors including diet (e.g., ingestion of saturated/unsaturated dietary fats, vitamins, minerals, dairy products, alcoholic beverages, polyphenols containing food such as cocoa-rich chocolate, tea, or coffee), dietary patterns, geographical area, and diet-related habits (sometimes varying between males and females) and sex (the influence of sex hormones). A positive correlation between polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (N-3 PUFA), and alpha-linolenic acid (aLNA) ingestion and protection against PD development in dose-response trends was demonstrated. American studies demonstrated that PUFA replacement with increased animal fat intake (Western Diet) significantly increased the risk of PD in males only. Excessive animal fat intake can promote dysbiosis and the production of harmful microbial metabolites, which can increase the prevalence of the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, sex differences are implicated in the mental health and prevalence of psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, and neurodegenerative disorders. It has been demonstrated that PD patients usually have altered microbiome compositions compared with controls. Similar to AD, many sex differences in PD are correlated with the protective nature of estrogens, as they are impacted by the gut-brain axis and protect against oxidative damage, thereby supporting dopaminergic function. It has been demonstrated that at age 45, the estimated overall lifetime risk for AD is about 20% for females and 10% for males, which is followed by a disruption in the patient's gut microbiota composition.

"It is currently controversial whether supplementation with BCAAs would increase circulating BCAAs, thereby increasing the risk of diabetes. And reducing BCAAs intake promotes fat mass loss and insulin sensitivity in mice with obesity. A high BCAAs diet causes excessive feeding, mainly due to excessive appetite. Adding threonine to balance the composition of amino acids in the diet can inhibit food intake. Nevertheless, some studies have found that supplementary BCAAs, such as isoleucine and leucine, can improve insulin resistance and reduce weight to lower the risk of obesity and diabetes. The inconsistency may be due to the individual state of energy excess or energy deficiency. In terms of an excessive energy state, such as in patients with obesity or diabetes who have an impaired ability to degrade BCAAs, BCAAs and related metabolites accumulate in circulation to reduce insulin sensitivity and cause insulin resistance. In most elderly people with inadequate energy or athletes who maintain good fitness habits, BCAAs can improve the form of metabolism. In these people, BCAAs decomposition metabolism is increased by regulatory factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha coactivator (PGC-1alpha) and PPARalpha, so that BCAAs levels are maintained in a steady state, which ultimately promotes glucose intake and insulin sensitivity. This was supported by the study of Newgard, who pointed out that dietary intake of BCAAs might interact with a high-fat diet to induce abnormal metabolic phenotypes such as insulin resistance. Mice fed BCAAs alone did not develop insulin resistance. However, when mice were fed a high-fat diet supplemented with BCAAs, they developed insulin resistance. This study suggested that BCAAs only lead to insulin resistance in the presence of excess energy intake. Therefore, more studies are needed to explore the supplementation with BCAAs and insulin resistance as well as the development of cardiovascular risk factors.",19341206.0,2484,2485,insulin,1911.0,1918.0,Gene,1705.0,1712.0,insulin,Gene,None

"The gut microbiome is crucially engaged in the regulation and maintenance of human health and homeostasis, i.e., proper intestine motion, fibre digestion, regulating the development of host immunity, and exerting a protective effect against pathogenic factors (such as Campylobacter jejuni, Helicobacter pylori, and Clostridium difficile). The Irish ELDERMET study (Elderly to benefit from Research Project) demonstrated the correlation between intestinal microbiota diversity and health outcomes such as overall health, frailty, and proper immune functions, underlying the gut microbiota composition as a possible indicator of healthy ageing. Multiple studies showed the interplay between the intestinal microbiota and modulation of central nervous system (CNS) functions and neurodegeneration processes, pointing to the microbiome-gut-brain axis as one of the factors modulating host homeostasis in health and disease. In the past decade, the alterations of the gut microbiota, which are called dysbiosis, have been connected with the pathophysiology of numerous common diseases such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, gastrointestinal diseases, and cardiovascular events. Dysbiosis state is also implicated in neurological and neurodegenerative disorders such as autism, and Alzheimer's (AD) or Parkinson's (PD) diseases.

"In fact, changes in the function of gut microecology and gut microbiota may cause the occurrence and exacerbation of various diseases. It was found that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota may lead to decreased cardiac function and increased cardiomyopathy as well as cardiac insufficiency, which is of great significance in predicting CVDs and also has important predictive significance for the prognosis of adverse cardiovascular events. The gut microbiota has been reported to be associated with CVDs and its corresponding risk factors, such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, and insulin resistance. These risk factors may affect the composition and the diversity of gut microbiota. In addition, gut dysbiosis is also linked to inflammation, oxidative stress, platelet activity, thrombosis and atherosclerosis, which contribute to the progression of CVDs. The possible mechanism of gut microbiota dysbiosis related to CVDs includes its role in increasing intestinal permeability and triggering inflammation via the LPS/TLR4 as well as NLRP3 pathways, thereby ultimately contributing to the development of CVDs.

"Recent evidence has demonstrated the importance of the gut microbiota in the formation and development of the immune system. The gut microbiota has profound effects on the formation of lymphoid tissue and the development of the immune system. It stimulates the development of intestinal-associated lymphoid tissues, activates lymphocytes, and regulates the production of immunoglobulin A to defend against pathogens. The structural components of gut microbiota such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), flagella, and peptidoglycan, can interact with receptors on human cells to stimulate and guide the host immune response. For instance, LPS binds to Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, flagella binds to TLR5, and peptidoglycan binds to TLR2, triggering the expression of a large number of downstream inflammatory factors, thereby affecting the cardiovascular system. Specially, LPS can interact with different receptors to induce inflammation and immune responses to increase intestinal permeability and CVDs susceptibility (Fig. 1).",16622924.0,279,iUvf2uhQJd,lipopolysaccharide,469.0,487.0,Chemical,509.0,522.0,peptidoglycan,Chemical,None
"Given that the gut microbiota is essential in human health, changes in the composition and function of the gut microbiota may result in the development of diseases. Due to the influence of host genes, diet, antibiotic use, lifestyle, drugs as well as other factors, the composition and diversity of gut microbiota gradually change with interindividual variation. For example, a high-fat diet leads to an increase in the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. When the composition and proportion of gut microbiota change, inflammation and metabolic abnormalities can be induced, which contribute to the development of different diseases. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota refers to changes in the number, species and composition of gut microbiota. In recent years, gut microbiota dysbiosis has been shown to be critically involved in health and has emerged as a potential pathogenesis for various diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, cancers, and CVDs. Moreover, gut dysbiosis is also a driver of metabolic inflammation and metabolic dysregulation, which serve as a key feature of metabolic diseases. For instance, the translocation of intestinal bacteria to the blood and liver through the portal venous system together with its metabolites are able to stimulate the release of inflammatory factors, and promote the occurrence of non-alcoholic fatty liver as well as hepatitis.

"At the end of this chapter, it is worth mentioning the fact that the interaction between the microbiome and the host is bidirectional, and some metabolic changes, which could be a pathological result of disease progression, also influence microbiome metabolism.

In addition, alteration of the intestinal microbiota composition with the subsequent fluctuations in the serum and brain levels of bile acids (BAs) is involved in the development of AD.

"In the past decade, single dietary factors which can positively manipulate the gut microbiota-brain axis through microbiome modulation have gained significant attention. One of these factors is probiotic bacteria and/or prebiotics. Probiotics are defined as microbial organisms with a beneficial role in the host's health and homeostasis, which help to preserve digestive, metabolic, immune, and neuroendocrine functions. Naturally probiotic bacteria can be found in fermented food. Experimental results revealed that the administration of probiotics alone or in combination with prebiotics (fructooligosaccharides or galactooligosaccharides) improved the gastrointestinal barrier, which is the first line of ""defence"" from harmful factors occurring in food, and the microbiome. Probiotics and prebiotics are well-documented ""problem-solution"" for gastrointestinal diseases.

Many studies indicate that the ingestion of probiotics can serve as a microbiological strategy against neurodegenerative diseases such as AD; however, the exact mechanism is under investigation. Experiments performed on mice underline the hypothesis that mechanisms related to neuroprotective effects of Bifidobacterium breve administration may be connected with neuroinflammation and cognition pathways, probably through the production of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) neurotransmitter and the regulation of the gut microbial composition.

"SCFAs may prevent obesity by regulating the homeostasis of glucose and lipid metabolism. For instance, acetate decreases appetite and nutrient intake. Propionate activates intestinal gluconeogenesis by a gut-brain neural circuit to promote energy balance. Butyrate provides energy for colon cells, maintains the integrity of intestinal walls, and improves the insulin response, which activates gluconeogenesis to maintain the balance of glucose and energy through the cAMP pathway. And one study indicated that oral butyrate intake prevents obesity and insulin resistance. Furthermore, the role of SCFAs in metabolic hemostasis is related to other factors. Adenosine monophosphate activating protein (AMPK) is a heterotrimeric enzyme that stimulates liver and muscle fatty acid oxidation pathways. SCFAs promote the activity of AMPK and improve its ability to oxidize fatty acids. Last, SCFAs can affect the development of dyslipidemia. SCFAs increase the expression of fasting-induced adipose factor (FIAF), a circulating lipoprotein lipase inhibitor, by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-gamma), thereby decreasing the activity of lipoproteinases and inhibiting lipolysis in adipose tissues.

"Aromatic amino acids including tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine are metabolized into indole and phenols by certain intestinal anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, and Peptostreptococcus. Tryptophan is decomposed into indole, indoleacetic acid, indole-3-lactic acid, 3-methylindole (skatole) and other indole compounds under the action of tryptophanase. Tryptophanase is the key enzyme that generates indole. The activity of the enzyme is easily induced by the substrate tryptophan, so when the amount of tryptophan changes in the colonic environment, the content of indole will fluctuate greatly. Of note, the metabolic products of aromatic amino acids generated by gut microbiota have a great impact on the pathology of cardiometabolic diseases. For example, indole propionic acid is associated with insulin sensitivity and appears to reduce the risk of diabetes. Moreover, the gut microbiota metabolizes dietary tryptophan to indoxyl, which further generates indoxyl sulfate through sulfonation. Excessive accumulation of indoxyl sulfate causes cardiomyocyte damage and increases thrombus formation. Another phenol compound, 4-methylphenol, can inhibit the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into mature adipocytes, induce apoptosis and reduce glucose uptake. In addition, benzoic acid is an aromatic carboxylic acid synthesized by colonic microorganisms by metabolizing dietary aromatic compounds.

"Scientific evidence indicates that the metabolic status of microbiota exerts a more important role than the equilibrium between bacterial species. Microbial metabolites can act as positive modulators of the gut-brain-axis constituents, boosting the immune cells and exerting a positive/protective effect on neurodegenerative disease progression. On the other hand, disrupted equilibrium between microbial species often leads to specific switches in the microbial metabolome, which may be harmful and associated with neurodegenerative disease progression. For example, dysregulation of Gram-negative bacteria in the gastrointestinal area leads to the production of harmful metabolites (i.e., endo- and exotoxins, saccharides, and amyloids). Exotoxins, such as LPS, which have the ability to activate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, exert negative effects. LPS belongs to glycolipid molecules, mostly produced by Gram-negative bacterial strains. These molecules participate in the integrity maintenance of the bacterial outer-membrane permeability barrier, playing an important role in host-pathogen interplay. The overproduction of bacterial LPS can cause the activation of the macrophage-monocyte nod-like receptor P3 inflammasome, therefore stimulating the production of cytokines with pro-inflammatory activity, such as IL-18 or IL-1beta. LPS can be translocated and intensify neuroinflammatory diseases such as AD.

"The origins of Parkinson's disease are the result of many factors such as increased age, polygenic factors (disease-segregating mutations in alpha-synuclein protein occurring in 15% of PD patients), toxins, and infectious agents. In 2006, Braak et al. assumed the gut-related origins of Parkinson's disease. One of the key pathological hallmarks of PD is Lewy bodies, being eosinophilic inclusion forms of misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates. Importantly, alpha-synuclein protein has a tendency to misfold and form aggregates. Its accumulation has been detected during bacterial and viral infections in the gut. Moreover, it can be recognized as a characteristic indicator of PD neural degeneration. This protein aggregate can boost the local immune response. Interestingly, alpha-synuclein deposition has been confirmed in the neurons of the intestinal submucosa, together with a possibility of the alpha-synuclein transport to the brain via the vagus nerve (translocation of prion-like proteins). Misfolded alpha-synuclein triggers neuronal dysfunction and progressive degeneration, thereby enabling disease progression. Additionally, alpha-synuclein deposition in CNS is associated with intestinal hyperpermeability, TLRs, and pro-inflammatory cytokine overexpression.

"In the past decade, single dietary factors which can positively manipulate the gut microbiota-brain axis through microbiome modulation have gained significant attention. One of these factors is probiotic bacteria and/or prebiotics. Probiotics are defined as microbial organisms with a beneficial role in the host's health and homeostasis, which help to preserve digestive, metabolic, immune, and neuroendocrine functions. Naturally probiotic bacteria can be found in fermented food. Experimental results revealed that the administration of probiotics alone or in combination with prebiotics (fructooligosaccharides or galactooligosaccharides) improved the gastrointestinal barrier, which is the first line of ""defence"" from harmful factors occurring in food, and the microbiome. Probiotics and prebiotics are well-documented ""problem-solution"" for gastrointestinal diseases. Moreover, probiotics can reduce CNS inflammatory processes and activation of microglia, demonstrating promising potential for use in neurodegenerative diseases as ingestible ""psychobiotics"". Many studies indicate that the ingestion of probiotics can serve as a microbiological strategy against neurodegenerative diseases such as AD; however, the exact mechanism is under investigation. Experiments performed on mice underline the hypothesis that mechanisms related to neuroprotective effects of Bifidobacterium breve administration may be connected with neuroinflammation and cognition pathways, probably through the production of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) neurotransmitter and the regulation of the gut microbial composition. Clinical results of a randomized double-blind controlled trial revealed that 3-month exposure to Lactobacillus spp. And a Bifidobacterium bifidum ""cocktail"" enhanced cognitive functions and memory, as examined in a mini-mental state test.

"Experimental research confirms the hypothesis regarding SCFA reduction in autoimmune diseases (MS among others) and altered gut microbiota. A low level of SCFAs dysregulates Treg cell functions, leading to insufficient immune tolerance towards endogenous components and enteric microbiota. However, this process can be reversed by SCFAs supplementation (e.g., propionic acid). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing NFkappaB activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation and on microglial cells in vitro. TUDCA binds to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) expressed in microglial cells. This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS). Experimental results demonstrated that TUDCA acted as a double-edged sword, triggering microglia enhancement in anti-inflammatory and alternatively activated markers and on the other hand reducing the infiltration of macrophages and microglia with expressed pro-inflammatory markers. Interestingly, during neuroinflammation, microglial cells change their morphology, converting themselves into reactive macrophage-like forms. However, microglial cells are flexible, as they can sometimes polarize towards alternatively activated phenotypes, promoting CNS pathologies (proinflammatory or M1 microglia), or exert anti-inflammatory effects, boosting cell repair and remodeling. Bile acids were identified as nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor agonists, leading to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) depletion (in a mouse model) and neuroinflammatory process adjustment. The administration of the complex probiotic positively influenced the intestinal flora balance in patients diagnosed with MS.

"In fact, changes in the function of gut microecology and gut microbiota may cause the occurrence and exacerbation of various diseases.

The gut microbiota has been reported to be associated with CVDs and its corresponding risk factors, such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, and insulin resistance. These risk factors may affect the composition and the diversity of gut microbiota. In addition, gut dysbiosis is also linked to inflammation, oxidative stress, platelet activity, thrombosis and atherosclerosis, which contribute to the progression of CVDs. The possible mechanism of gut microbiota dysbiosis related to CVDs includes its role in increasing intestinal permeability and triggering inflammation via the LPS/TLR4 as well as NLRP3 pathways, thereby ultimately contributing to the development of CVDs.

"Mechanically, current studies suggest that SCFAs may exert their functions through acting as energy substrates and maintaining metabolic integration by a variety of different downstream regulatory mechanisms, such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPRs) with GPR41/Recombinant Free Fatty Acid Receptor (FFAR3), GPR43/FFAR2, GPR109A, Olfactory Receptors 78 (Olfr78) in endocrine cells of the gut wall, as well as histone deacetylases (HDACs) (Fig. 2). GPR41 regulates host energy acquisition and promotes the catabolism of glucose and lipids. The decreased SCFAs may cause less activated GPR41 and higher levels of energy uptake. In addition, it has also been reported that the lower production of SCFAs in gut microbiota would increase the host's capability of obtaining energy from the diet. SCFAs from bacterial fermentation promote the secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY) through GPR43 and GPR41 from intestinal L cells. GLP-1 increased pancreatic insulin secretion, and inhibited the production of glucagon. Deletion of GLP-1 abolished the beneficial effects of prebiotics on weight gain, glucose metabolism, and inflammatory pathway activation.

"The mechanism by which BCAAs induce insulin resistance is still not fully understood. The rise of BCAA levels is found to regulate glycolipid metabolism, cause insulin resistance, and increase the risk of T2D. Other animal experiments have shown that elevated BCAAs are transferred to skeletal muscle, and are interfered with lipid metabolism, which causes the accumulation of lipid metabolites and ultimately leads to skeletal muscle insulin resistance. Additionally, BCAAs are the key regulatory factor of mTORC1. It activates mTORC1 and ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (S6K1) by inducing the phosphorylation of IRS1, blocking the insulin signaling pathway, and eventually causing insulin resistance. However, 2 other studies have shown that BCAAs may exert their functions without mTORC1. One study reported that the metabolites of BCAAs, 3-hydroxy isobutyrate, could cause insulin resistance by promoting skeletal muscle sprouting.

"Scientific evidence indicates that the metabolic status of microbiota exerts a more important role than the equilibrium between bacterial species. Microbial metabolites can act as positive modulators of the gut-brain-axis constituents, boosting the immune cells and exerting a positive/protective effect on neurodegenerative disease progression. On the other hand, disrupted equilibrium between microbial species often leads to specific switches in the microbial metabolome, which may be harmful and associated with neurodegenerative disease progression. For example, dysregulation of Gram-negative bacteria in the gastrointestinal area leads to the production of harmful metabolites (i.e., endo- and exotoxins, saccharides, and amyloids). Exotoxins, such as LPS, which have the ability to activate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, exert negative effects. LPS belongs to glycolipid molecules, mostly produced by Gram-negative bacterial strains. These molecules participate in the integrity maintenance of the bacterial outer-membrane permeability barrier, playing an important role in host-pathogen interplay. The overproduction of bacterial LPS can cause the activation of the macrophage-monocyte nod-like receptor P3 inflammasome, therefore stimulating the production of cytokines with pro-inflammatory activity, such as IL-18 or IL-1beta. LPS can be translocated and intensify neuroinflammatory diseases such as AD. Additionally, it was demonstrated that IL-1beta can decrease the phagocytic function of microglial cells, stimulating the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, and causing reduced synaptic plasticity and cognitive deterioration.

"The PD microbiome has a diminished variety of bacterial taxonomic groups, especially the ones associated with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects and the increase of phyla, which has toxic effects. Predominantly, the reduction was observed in the Lachnospiraceae family, including Butyrivibrio, Pseudobutyrivibrio, Coprococcus, Blautia and SCFAs-producing Prevotellaceae. The increased amount of Enterobacteriaceae is linked to the severity of postural instability and walking difficulties. Moreover, the PD microbiome is characterised by increased Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium species and decreased amount of Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae. The overgrowth of Akkermansia spp. in PD patients may be strain-specific and can be related to immune-response alterations, decreased mucus thicknesses, and increased constipation. Faecalibacterium family is a crucial player producing SCFAs and anti-inflammatory metabolites, maintaining gut health. Faecalibacterium balance disturbances can lead to impaired gut-barrier function, increasing the risk of infection with enteric pathogens and boosting alpha-synuclein formation. Similarly, the Lachnospiraceae family can produce butyrate, important for the proper function of the gut epithelium. Decreased Lachnospiraceae quantity might aggravate gut inflammation, stimulate toxin production, and damage the integrity of the gut epithelial barrier. PD patients' intestinal microflora were characterised by a diminished abundance of Lachnospiraceae, which was positively correlated with PD progress, cognitive decline, and impaired motor functions. These microbiome's compositional changes correlate well with some metabolic switches. PD microbiota show reduced SCFAs production, decreased carbohydrate fermentation, and augmented proteolytic fermentation. Chen et al. demonstrated that the SCFA level was relevant to microbiota composition changes and the clinical severity of PD. The levels of SCFAs acetate, butyrate, and propionate in fecal samples of PD patients were significantly reduced, contrary to their elevated concentration in plasma. Rodent models of PD disease have shown a positive effect of SCFAs on behavior and PD symptoms. Butyrate, as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, exerts neuroprotective activity, reducing dopaminergic cell death, and motor impairment, and improving cognitive functions. Taken together, SCFAs play an important role in protection from PD disease and could be proposed as representative gut-oriented indicators for diversifying individuals with PD and placing disease progression.",16553034.0,1000,984,patients,702.0,710.0,Species,699.0,701.0,PD,Disease,experiences

Naturally probiotic bacteria can be found in fermented food. Experimental results revealed that the administration of probiotics alone or in combination with prebiotics (fructooligosaccharides or galactooligosaccharides) improved the gastrointestinal barrier, which is the first line of ""defence"" from harmful factors occurring in food, and the microbiome.

"Previous results have indicated that the metabolic regulation of BAs may be associated with T2D but the specific changes in BAs and the related mechanisms remain to be studied.

A study also suggested that patients with T2D had no change in plasma total BAs, but had an increase in DCA and a decrease in CDCA in plasma. Another study found that the plasma total BA concentration in patients with T2D was not significantly different from that of healthy people; however, the concentration of DCA in the plasma of patients with T2D was significantly higher than that of healthy controls. The mechanism may be that FXR and TGR5 are inhibited during insulin resistance, and the most effective natural ligands of the receptors, DCA and CA, are compensatorily increased. Besides, circulating BAs levels including DCA, TCA, TDCA, and glycodeoxycholic acid, are positively associated with the risk of T2D, while taurohyodeoxycholic acid is negatively associated with diabetes. This may be due to the fact that hydrophobic BAs isoforms (such as DCA) have been shown to be involved in inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress with glucose dysregulation, and hydrophilic BAs isoforms (such as tauroursodeoxycholic acid) have been shown to prevent inflammation and enhance insulin sensitivity.",18340523.0,2032,XHwnfrVaWI,glycodeoxycholic acid,905.0,926.0,Chemical,971.0,974.0,T2D,Disease,Associated_with
"Aromatic amino acids including tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine are metabolized into indole and phenols by certain intestinal anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, and Peptostreptococcus. Tryptophan is decomposed into indole, indoleacetic acid, indole-3-lactic acid, 3-methylindole (skatole) and other indole compounds under the action of tryptophanase. Tryptophanase is the key enzyme that generates indole. The activity of the enzyme is easily induced by the substrate tryptophan, so when the amount of tryptophan changes in the colonic environment, the content of indole will fluctuate greatly. Of note, the metabolic products of aromatic amino acids generated by gut microbiota have a great impact on the pathology of cardiometabolic diseases. For example, indole propionic acid is associated with insulin sensitivity and appears to reduce the risk of diabetes. Moreover, the gut microbiota metabolizes dietary tryptophan to indoxyl, which further generates indoxyl sulfate through sulfonation. Excessive accumulation of indoxyl sulfate causes cardiomyocyte damage and increases thrombus formation. Another phenol compound, 4-methylphenol, can inhibit the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into mature adipocytes, induce apoptosis and reduce glucose uptake.

"The health of the gut microbiome can vary depending on various factors including diet (e.g., ingestion of saturated/unsaturated dietary fats, vitamins, minerals, dairy products, alcoholic beverages, polyphenols containing food such as cocoa-rich chocolate, tea, or coffee), dietary patterns, geographical area, and diet-related habits (sometimes varying between males and females) and sex (the influence of sex hormones). A positive correlation between polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (N-3 PUFA), and alpha-linolenic acid (aLNA) ingestion and protection against PD development in dose-response trends was demonstrated. American studies demonstrated that PUFA replacement with increased animal fat intake (Western Diet) significantly increased the risk of PD in males only. Excessive animal fat intake can promote dysbiosis and the production of harmful microbial metabolites, which can increase the prevalence of the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, sex differences are implicated in the mental health and prevalence of psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, and neurodegenerative disorders. It has been demonstrated that PD patients usually have altered microbiome compositions compared with controls. Similar to AD, many sex differences in PD are correlated with the protective nature of estrogens, as they are impacted by the gut-brain axis and protect against oxidative damage, thereby supporting dopaminergic function. It has been demonstrated that at age 45, the estimated overall lifetime risk for AD is about 20% for females and 10% for males, which is followed by a disruption in the patient's gut microbiota composition. In summary, it is worth underlining the correlation between the gut microbiome, immune system and brain, mental health, and behavior.",16221004.0,1834,1840,polyunsaturated fatty acids,453.0,480.0,Chemical,602.0,604.0,PD,Disease,prevents
"Aromatic amino acids including tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine are metabolized into indole and phenols by certain intestinal anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, and Peptostreptococcus. Tryptophan is decomposed into indole, indoleacetic acid, indole-3-lactic acid, 3-methylindole (skatole) and other indole compounds under the action of tryptophanase. Tryptophanase is the key enzyme that generates indole. The activity of the enzyme is easily induced by the substrate tryptophan, so when the amount of tryptophan changes in the colonic environment, the content of indole will fluctuate greatly. Of note, the metabolic products of aromatic amino acids generated by gut microbiota have a great impact on the pathology of cardiometabolic diseases. For example, indole propionic acid is associated with insulin sensitivity and appears to reduce the risk of diabetes. Moreover, the gut microbiota metabolizes dietary tryptophan to indoxyl, which further generates indoxyl sulfate through sulfonation. Excessive accumulation of indoxyl sulfate causes cardiomyocyte damage and increases thrombus formation. Another phenol compound, 4-methylphenol, can inhibit the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into mature adipocytes, induce apoptosis and reduce glucose uptake. In addition, benzoic acid is an aromatic carboxylic acid synthesized by colonic microorganisms by metabolizing dietary aromatic compounds.

"At present, it is generally believed that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota is an important factor affecting the integrity of the intestinal barrier. Previous studies showed that the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota could lead to the rapid proliferation of intestinal pathogenic bacteria, and the pro-inflammatory factors released by them seriously damaged the structure and function of the intestinal barrier, and it also promoted the occurrence and development of diseases in the digestive system as well as metabolic system. Furthermore, the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota triggers intestinal mucosal barrier damage, leading to inflammation and disordered nutrient metabolism. Overactivated inflammation caused by microbiota dysbiosis disrupts normal intestinal mucosal barrier function, and increases intestinal permeability to promote bacterial translocation, leading to endotoxemia and inflammation, thereby increasing the risk of CVDs.",16622110.0,qK7s-FlMP3,240,gut microbiota,198.0,212.0,Species,181.0,190.0,dysbiosis,Disease,experiences
"Given that the gut microbiota is essential in human health, changes in the composition and function of the gut microbiota may result in the development of diseases. Due to the influence of host genes, diet, antibiotic use, lifestyle, drugs as well as other factors, the composition and diversity of gut microbiota gradually change with interindividual variation. For example, a high-fat diet leads to an increase in the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. When the composition and proportion of gut microbiota change, inflammation and metabolic abnormalities can be induced, which contribute to the development of different diseases. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota refers to changes in the number, species and composition of gut microbiota. In recent years, gut microbiota dysbiosis has been shown to be critically involved in health and has emerged as a potential pathogenesis for various diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, cancers, and CVDs. Moreover, gut dysbiosis is also a driver of metabolic inflammation and metabolic dysregulation, which serve as a key feature of metabolic diseases. For instance, the translocation of intestinal bacteria to the blood and liver through the portal venous system together with its metabolites are able to stimulate the release of inflammatory factors, and promote the occurrence of non-alcoholic fatty liver as well as hepatitis.

"The mechanism by which BCAAs induce insulin resistance is still not fully understood. The rise of BCAA levels is found to regulate glycolipid metabolism, cause insulin resistance, and increase the risk of T2D. Other animal experiments have shown that elevated BCAAs are transferred to skeletal muscle, and are interfered with lipid metabolism, which causes the accumulation of lipid metabolites and ultimately leads to skeletal muscle insulin resistance. Additionally, BCAAs are the key regulatory factor of mTORC1. It activates mTORC1 and ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (S6K1) by inducing the phosphorylation of IRS1, blocking the insulin signaling pathway, and eventually causing insulin resistance. However, 2 other studies have shown that BCAAs may exert their functions without mTORC1. One study reported that the metabolites of BCAAs, 3-hydroxy isobutyrate, could cause insulin resistance by promoting skeletal muscle sprouting. Another study reported that a diet rich in BCAAs can cause overeating, obesity, and shortened lifespan, which was not related to the mTOR signaling pathway in the liver but is mainly due to hyperphagia.",18449544.0,FyT4I6Ve1e,gXjKMzB8jA,shortened lifespan,1023.0,1041.0,Disease,1072.0,1077.0,mTOR ,Species,Negative_correlation

"BAs, as by-products of cholesterol metabolism, are the main organic component of bile and are synthesized in hepatocytes. Cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) are primary BAs directly synthesized from cholesterol; secondary BAs include deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholic acid (LCA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and their glycine and taurine conjugated forms. BAs are excreted into the intestine to aid in the digestion and absorption of lipids and combine with farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and takeda-G-protein receptor 5 (TGR5) (Fig. 2). There is a strong biochemical relationship between BAs and gut microbiota. Some gut microbiota in healthy people can convert conjugated BAs into free BAs, and can transform BAs into secondary BAs with the help of bile salt hydrolase (BSH) and cholesterol 7-alpha hydroxy-lase (CYP7A1), so as to reduce blood cholesterol by affecting the enterohepatic circulation of BAs. Besides, the gut microbiota affects the metabolism of BAs by regulating the activity of BSH to reduce LDL cholesterol levels. BAs have bacteriostatic properties and an antimicrobial effect. BAs destroy the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane and thereby change the intestinal microecology. BAs also prevent bacteria from overgrowth and decrease inflammation. More importantly, BAs are also closely associated with CVDs. For example, BAs levels in the feces of patients with CVDs are different from those in healthy individuals.

In mechanism, TMAO enhances platelet hyperreactivity by altering Ca2+ signaling and elicits a pro-thrombotic effect. Especially, TMAO seems to induce systemic inflammation that contributes to CAD progression.

"Experimental research confirms the hypothesis regarding SCFA reduction in autoimmune diseases (MS among others) and altered gut microbiota. A low level of SCFAs dysregulates Treg cell functions, leading to insufficient immune tolerance towards endogenous components and enteric microbiota. However, this process can be reversed by SCFAs supplementation (e.g., propionic acid). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing NFkappaB activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation and on microglial cells in vitro. TUDCA binds to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) expressed in microglial cells. This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS). Experimental results demonstrated that TUDCA acted as a double-edged sword, triggering microglia enhancement in anti-inflammatory and alternatively activated markers and on the other hand reducing the infiltration of macrophages and microglia with expressed pro-inflammatory markers. Interestingly, during neuroinflammation, microglial cells change their morphology, converting themselves into reactive macrophage-like forms. However, microglial cells are flexible, as they can sometimes polarize towards alternatively activated phenotypes, promoting CNS pathologies (proinflammatory or M1 microglia), or exert anti-inflammatory effects, boosting cell repair and remodeling. Bile acids were identified as nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor agonists, leading to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) depletion (in a mouse model) and neuroinflammatory process adjustment. The administration of the complex probiotic positively influenced the intestinal flora balance in patients diagnosed with MS.

"In the past decade, single dietary factors which can positively manipulate the gut microbiota-brain axis through microbiome modulation have gained significant attention. One of these factors is probiotic bacteria and/or prebiotics. Probiotics are defined as microbial organisms with a beneficial role in the host's health and homeostasis, which help to preserve digestive, metabolic, immune, and neuroendocrine functions. Naturally probiotic bacteria can be found in fermented food. Experimental results revealed that the administration of probiotics alone or in combination with prebiotics (fructooligosaccharides or galactooligosaccharides) improved the gastrointestinal barrier, which is the first line of ""defence"" from harmful factors occurring in food, and the microbiome.

"It is currently controversial whether supplementation with BCAAs would increase circulating BCAAs, thereby increasing the risk of diabetes. And reducing BCAAs intake promotes fat mass loss and insulin sensitivity in mice with obesity. A high BCAAs diet causes excessive feeding, mainly due to excessive appetite. Adding threonine to balance the composition of amino acids in the diet can inhibit food intake. Nevertheless, some studies have found that supplementary BCAAs, such as isoleucine and leucine, can improve insulin resistance and reduce weight to lower the risk of obesity and diabetes. The inconsistency may be due to the individual state of energy excess or energy deficiency. In terms of an excessive energy state, such as in patients with obesity or diabetes who have an impaired ability to degrade BCAAs, BCAAs and related metabolites accumulate in circulation to reduce insulin sensitivity and cause insulin resistance. In most elderly people with inadequate energy or athletes who maintain good fitness habits, BCAAs can improve the form of metabolism. In these people, BCAAs decomposition metabolism is increased by regulatory factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha coactivator (PGC-1alpha) and PPARalpha, so that BCAAs levels are maintained in a steady state, which ultimately promotes glucose intake and insulin sensitivity. This was supported by the study of Newgard, who pointed out that dietary intake of BCAAs might interact with a high-fat diet to induce abnormal metabolic phenotypes such as insulin resistance. Mice fed BCAAs alone did not develop insulin resistance. However, when mice were fed a high-fat diet supplemented with BCAAs, they developed insulin resistance. This study suggested that BCAAs only lead to insulin resistance in the presence of excess energy intake. Therefore, more studies are needed to explore the supplementation with BCAAs and insulin resistance as well as the development of cardiovascular risk factors.",19341206.0,2451,2467,isoleucine,481.0,491.0,Chemical,587.0,595.0,diabetes,Disease,prevents

"Besides the propagation of an inflammatory state, microbial endotoxins are probably involved in AD's inflammatory amyloidosis. Metagenomics analysis showed that patients suffering from cognitive dysfunctions related to amyloidosis demonstrated elevated amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neurotoxic compounds. In these patients, increased inflammation was probably related to Eubacterium deficiency, and an overabundance of gram-negative Escherichia and Shigella species, which are known amyloid producers. They manufacture ""curli"" amyloid fibers, accumulated extracellularly through an elaborated system. Further studies revealed that the overproduction of Abeta plaques is correlated with excessive growth of Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycobacterium and Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus spp.. Galloway et al. found Abeta in small intestine epithelial cells, suggesting that gut-derived amyloids could be absorbed and finally reach systemic circulation, where they can act as pro-inflammatory factors and trigger fibrillogenesis. Additionally, it was shown that amyloids generated by microbes can influence IL-17A and IL-22 proinflammatory cytokines production, considered as a key players in NFkappaB signaling, both associated with AD and capable of crossing the BBB and GI tract.",16171393.0,711,63MRdwABpX,Abeta,665.0,670.0,Species,778.0,791.0,Mycobacterium,Species,increase

"Previous results have indicated that the metabolic regulation of BAs may be associated with T2D but the specific changes in BAs and the related mechanisms remain to be studied. It is also unclear how the different types of BAs change in patients with T2D. A study also suggested that patients with T2D had no change in plasma total BAs, but had an increase in DCA and a decrease in CDCA in plasma. Another study found that the plasma total BA concentration in patients with T2D was not significantly different from that of healthy people; however, the concentration of DCA in the plasma of patients with T2D was significantly higher than that of healthy controls. The mechanism may be that FXR and TGR5 are inhibited during insulin resistance, and the most effective natural ligands of the receptors, DCA and CA, are compensatorily increased. Besides, circulating BAs levels including DCA, TCA, TDCA, and glycodeoxycholic acid, are positively associated with the risk of T2D, while taurohyodeoxycholic acid is negatively associated with diabetes. This may be due to the fact that hydrophobic BAs isoforms (such as DCA) have been shown to be involved in inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress with glucose dysregulation, and hydrophilic BAs isoforms (such as tauroursodeoxycholic acid) have been shown to prevent inflammation and enhance insulin sensitivity.",18340523.0,nclZJIUNmu,Gc8n1U3z84,T2D,251.0,254.0,Disease,223.0,226.0,BAs,Chemical,affects
"Particularly, SCFAs also have anti-inflammatory functions. It was reported that the butyrate and propionate can inhibit the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and NF-kappaB signaling pathways. These may be because that SCFAs can inhibit the activity of HDAC, inactivate the NF-kappaB pathway and decrease the expression of interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-6, and TNF-alpha, which further control inflammation. Meanwhile, butyrate increases the acetylation of H3 histone in the Forkhead box protein P3 (FOXP3) promoter by inhibiting HDAC4, thus promoting Treg differentiation, affecting G1-phase-specific cyclins, and further resulting in the markedly inhibited proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, thereby inhibiting myocardial fibrosis and improving heart function.",17066164.0,764,757,IL-2,331.0,335.0,Species,381.0,393.0,inflammation,Disease,causes

"The origins of Parkinson's disease are the result of many factors such as increased age, polygenic factors (disease-segregating mutations in alpha-synuclein protein occurring in 15% of PD patients), toxins, and infectious agents. In 2006, Braak et al. assumed the gut-related origins of Parkinson's disease. One of the key pathological hallmarks of PD is Lewy bodies, being eosinophilic inclusion forms of misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates. Importantly, alpha-synuclein protein has a tendency to misfold and form aggregates. Its accumulation has been detected during bacterial and viral infections in the gut. Moreover, it can be recognized as a characteristic indicator of PD neural degeneration. This protein aggregate can boost the local immune response. Interestingly, alpha-synuclein deposition has been confirmed in the neurons of the intestinal submucosa, together with a possibility of the alpha-synuclein transport to the brain via the vagus nerve (translocation of prion-like proteins). Misfolded alpha-synuclein triggers neuronal dysfunction and progressive degeneration, thereby enabling disease progression.

In mechanism, TMAO enhances platelet hyperreactivity by altering Ca2+ signaling and elicits a pro-thrombotic effect. Especially, TMAO seems to induce systemic inflammation that contributes to CAD progression.

"Trillions of microorganisms colonize the anaerobic and nutritious environment in the gut to form a healthy intestinal physiological ecosystem. These communities are regarded as ""gut microbiota"", and the sum total of all microorganism genomes in the gut, including their DNA sequences and other genetic information, are together called ""gut microbiomes"". Most intestinal microbial communities in the human intestinal tract are bacteria with complex structures. There are more than 1,000 species of intestinal bacteria, and the number reaches approximately 1014. The ratio of bacterial number to human cell number ranged from 10:1 to 1:1. It also contains 100-fold more genes than our own genome, which is called the second genome of the human body. In terms of the types of intestinal bacteria, the gut microbiota is mainly composed of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, and this composition is relatively stable in healthy individuals but not in patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) or other diseases. Among those gut microbiota, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in the large intestine account for about 90% of the total number of gut microbiota, and the ratio is a vital health indicator reflecting the condition of health and is also associated with the incidence of CVDs.

"The PD microbiome has a diminished variety of bacterial taxonomic groups, especially the ones associated with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects and the increase of phyla, which has toxic effects. Predominantly, the reduction was observed in the Lachnospiraceae family, including Butyrivibrio, Pseudobutyrivibrio, Coprococcus, Blautia and SCFAs-producing Prevotellaceae. The increased amount of Enterobacteriaceae is linked to the severity of postural instability and walking difficulties. Moreover, the PD microbiome is characterised by increased Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium species and decreased amount of Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae. The overgrowth of Akkermansia spp. in PD patients may be strain-specific and can be related to immune-response alterations, decreased mucus thicknesses, and increased constipation. Faecalibacterium family is a crucial player producing SCFAs and anti-inflammatory metabolites, maintaining gut health. Faecalibacterium balance disturbances can lead to impaired gut-barrier function, increasing the risk of infection with enteric pathogens and boosting alpha-synuclein formation. Similarly, the Lachnospiraceae family can produce butyrate, important for the proper function of the gut epithelium. Decreased Lachnospiraceae quantity might aggravate gut inflammation, stimulate toxin production, and damage the integrity of the gut epithelial barrier. PD patients' intestinal microflora were characterised by a diminished abundance of Lachnospiraceae, which was positively correlated with PD progress, cognitive decline, and impaired motor functions. These microbiome's compositional changes correlate well with some metabolic switches. PD microbiota show reduced SCFAs production, decreased carbohydrate fermentation, and augmented proteolytic fermentation. Chen et al. demonstrated that the SCFA level was relevant to microbiota composition changes and the clinical severity of PD. The levels of SCFAs acetate, butyrate, and propionate in fecal samples of PD patients were significantly reduced, contrary to their elevated concentration in plasma. Rodent models of PD disease have shown a positive effect of SCFAs on behavior and PD symptoms. Butyrate, as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, exerts neuroprotective activity, reducing dopaminergic cell death, and motor impairment, and improving cognitive functions.

"In the past decade, single dietary factors which can positively manipulate the gut microbiota-brain axis through microbiome modulation have gained significant attention. One of these factors is probiotic bacteria and/or prebiotics. Probiotics are defined as microbial organisms with a beneficial role in the host's health and homeostasis, which help to preserve digestive, metabolic, immune, and neuroendocrine functions. Naturally probiotic bacteria can be found in fermented food. Experimental results revealed that the administration of probiotics alone or in combination with prebiotics (fructooligosaccharides or galactooligosaccharides) improved the gastrointestinal barrier, which is the first line of ""defence"" from harmful factors occurring in food, and the microbiome. Probiotics and prebiotics are well-documented ""problem-solution"" for gastrointestinal diseases.

Many studies indicate that the ingestion of probiotics can serve as a microbiological strategy against neurodegenerative diseases such as AD; however, the exact mechanism is under investigation. Experiments performed on mice underline the hypothesis that mechanisms related to neuroprotective effects of Bifidobacterium breve administration may be connected with neuroinflammation and cognition pathways, probably through the production of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) neurotransmitter and the regulation of the gut microbial composition.

"Experimental research confirms the hypothesis regarding SCFA reduction in autoimmune diseases (MS among others) and altered gut microbiota. A low level of SCFAs dysregulates Treg cell functions, leading to insufficient immune tolerance towards endogenous components and enteric microbiota. However, this process can be reversed by SCFAs supplementation (e.g., propionic acid). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing NFkappaB activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation and on microglial cells in vitro. TUDCA binds to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) expressed in microglial cells. This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS). Experimental results demonstrated that TUDCA acted as a double-edged sword, triggering microglia enhancement in anti-inflammatory and alternatively activated markers and on the other hand reducing the infiltration of macrophages and microglia with expressed pro-inflammatory markers. Interestingly, during neuroinflammation, microglial cells change their morphology, converting themselves into reactive macrophage-like forms. However, microglial cells are flexible, as they can sometimes polarize towards alternatively activated phenotypes, promoting CNS pathologies (proinflammatory or M1 microglia), or exert anti-inflammatory effects, boosting cell repair and remodeling. Bile acids were identified as nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor agonists, leading to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) depletion (in a mouse model) and neuroinflammatory process adjustment. The administration of the complex probiotic positively influenced the intestinal flora balance in patients diagnosed with MS.

"The main end product of bacterial fermentation, and therefore the most predominant, is the SCFA propionic acid (PA), which positively influences CNS regeneration processes such as remyelination (due to the former increase of the amount of intestinal T regulatory cells and protecting against the white matter and axonal loss). Hoyles et al. demonstrated the contribution of propionate to the BBB integrity and the modulation of gut-brain axis. BBB homeostasis and integrity are necessary for proper CNS development and function. Recently, a positive correlation between microbial-induced BBB dysfunction (barrier integrity disturbances followed by leakage) and disorders such as AD has been established. Another member of the SCFAs family, which has a documented influence on homeostasis and AD progression, is butyrate, an important driver of metabolic processes with the ability to influence intestinal macrophages, increasing immunomodulation and decreasing the histone deacetylase inhibition-mediated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Butyrate, as an SCFA, influences the immune response crossing the BBB and drives the maturation and metabolism of microglia cells. It regulates the secretion of gut hormones, such as glucagon-like peptide-1, which can improve hippocampus neuroplasticity. Additionally, in vitro tests conducted by Ho et al. revealed that bacterial SCFAs, such as valeric and butyric acid, exhibited a strong inhibitory effect on amyloid-beta aggregation, which can be absorbed in the intestines and have a negative influence on disease progression.",16144118.0,441,QGF3lVU56P,Butyrate,1047.0,1055.0,Chemical,1161.0,1176.0,microglia cells,Cellline,Interacts_with
"Experimental research confirms the hypothesis regarding SCFA reduction in autoimmune diseases (MS among others) and altered gut microbiota. A low level of SCFAs dysregulates Treg cell functions, leading to insufficient immune tolerance towards endogenous components and enteric microbiota. However, this process can be reversed by SCFAs supplementation (e.g., propionic acid). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity.

"Recent evidence has demonstrated the importance of the gut microbiota in the formation and development of the immune system. The gut microbiota has profound effects on the formation of lymphoid tissue and the development of the immune system. It stimulates the development of intestinal-associated lymphoid tissues, activates lymphocytes, and regulates the production of immunoglobulin A to defend against pathogens. The structural components of gut microbiota such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), flagella, and peptidoglycan, can interact with receptors on human cells to stimulate and guide the host immune response. For instance, LPS binds to Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, flagella binds to TLR5, and peptidoglycan binds to TLR2, triggering the expression of a large number of downstream inflammatory factors, thereby affecting the cardiovascular system. Specially, LPS can interact with different receptors to induce inflammation and immune responses to increase intestinal permeability and CVDs susceptibility (Fig. 1).",16622924.0,iUvf2uhQJd,GV4G7wyy8r,peptidoglycan,509.0,522.0,Chemical,555.0,566.0,human cells,Cellline,Interacts_with

"Previous results have indicated that the metabolic regulation of BAs may be associated with T2D but the specific changes in BAs and the related mechanisms remain to be studied.

Another study found that the plasma total BA concentration in patients with T2D was not significantly different from that of healthy people; however, the concentration of DCA in the plasma of patients with T2D was significantly higher than that of healthy controls.

"However host-microbiota interplay is not exclusively restricted to cell-cell interactions. Intestinal microbes are capable of producing a plethora of different types of compounds, i.e., small molecules (amino acids, neurotransmitters, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and other fatty acid derivatives, indoles, vitamins, and cofactors), polysaccharides, and proteins (i.e., bacteriocins), which have been reported as important factors in shaping the bacterial community and modulation of the immune system. It has been demonstrated that intestinal bacterial strains such as Escherichia coli or Lactobacillus spp. interact directly with the host's CNS (central nervous system), as they can release neurotransmitters such as dopamine, noradrenaline, histamine, acetylcholine, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), or serotonin. This metabolic status of the microbiome is also vulnerable to dysbiosis and compositional changes and often leads to metabolic disturbances. For example, dysbiosis can induce elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, intensifying oxidative stress and neuronal inflammatory processes. It has been estimated that 40% of the metabolites detected in humans are the products of bacterial metabolism, which plays a fundamental role in the modulation of the host's physiological processes, including immune-mediated neurodegeneration or affecting neural cell metabolism.",16115776.0,129,115,Lactobacillus,593.0,606.0,Species,722.0,730.0,dopamine,Chemical,start

"Mechanically, current studies suggest that SCFAs may exert their functions through acting as energy substrates and maintaining metabolic integration by a variety of different downstream regulatory mechanisms, such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPRs) with GPR41/Recombinant Free Fatty Acid Receptor (FFAR3), GPR43/FFAR2, GPR109A, Olfactory Receptors 78 (Olfr78) in endocrine cells of the gut wall, as well as histone deacetylases (HDACs) (Fig. 2). GPR41 regulates host energy acquisition and promotes the catabolism of glucose and lipids. The decreased SCFAs may cause less activated GPR41 and higher levels of energy uptake. In addition, it has also been reported that the lower production of SCFAs in gut microbiota would increase the host's capability of obtaining energy from the diet. SCFAs from bacterial fermentation promote the secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY) through GPR43 and GPR41 from intestinal L cells. GLP-1 increased pancreatic insulin secretion, and inhibited the production of glucagon.

"The mechanism by which BCAAs induce insulin resistance is still not fully understood. The rise of BCAA levels is found to regulate glycolipid metabolism, cause insulin resistance, and increase the risk of T2D. Other animal experiments have shown that elevated BCAAs are transferred to skeletal muscle, and are interfered with lipid metabolism, which causes the accumulation of lipid metabolites and ultimately leads to skeletal muscle insulin resistance. Additionally, BCAAs are the key regulatory factor of mTORC1. It activates mTORC1 and ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (S6K1) by inducing the phosphorylation of IRS1, blocking the insulin signaling pathway, and eventually causing insulin resistance. However, 2 other studies have shown that BCAAs may exert their functions without mTORC1. One study reported that the metabolites of BCAAs, 3-hydroxy isobutyrate, could cause insulin resistance by promoting skeletal muscle sprouting. Another study reported that a diet rich in BCAAs can cause overeating, obesity, and shortened lifespan, which was not related to the mTOR signaling pathway in the liver but is mainly due to hyperphagia.",18449544.0,2352,yzxtghTRYi,BCAAs,982.0,987.0,Chemical,998.0,1008.0,overeating,Disease,causes
"Aromatic amino acids including tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine are metabolized into indole and phenols by certain intestinal anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, and Peptostreptococcus. Tryptophan is decomposed into indole, indoleacetic acid, indole-3-lactic acid, 3-methylindole (skatole) and other indole compounds under the action of tryptophanase. Tryptophanase is the key enzyme that generates indole. The activity of the enzyme is easily induced by the substrate tryptophan, so when the amount of tryptophan changes in the colonic environment, the content of indole will fluctuate greatly. Of note, the metabolic products of aromatic amino acids generated by gut microbiota have a great impact on the pathology of cardiometabolic diseases. For example, indole propionic acid is associated with insulin sensitivity and appears to reduce the risk of diabetes. Moreover, the gut microbiota metabolizes dietary tryptophan to indoxyl, which further generates indoxyl sulfate through sulfonation. Excessive accumulation of indoxyl sulfate causes cardiomyocyte damage and increases thrombus formation. Another phenol compound, 4-methylphenol, can inhibit the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into mature adipocytes, induce apoptosis and reduce glucose uptake. In addition, benzoic acid is an aromatic carboxylic acid synthesized by colonic microorganisms by metabolizing dietary aromatic compounds.

"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal health condition caused by the progressive neural death of the spinal cord, brain stem, and motor cortex neurons, causing advanced weakness, paralysis, eating difficulties, and respiratory failure. One of the main signs of ALS is the accumulation of phosphorylated protein, which binds to DNA in the form of protein aggregates deposited in glia and motor neurons. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) methods, such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing, have demonstrated the alteration of numerous bacteria, including Parabacteroides distasonis, Lactobacillus gasseri, Prevotella melaninogenica, Ruminococcus torques, and Akkermansia muciniphila. Changes in bacterial abundance and diversity correlate with ASL origins (as one of the environmental factors) together with impaired metabolism, immunological functions, and toxin accumulation, leading to brain damage. It has been demonstrated that Akkermansia muciniphila alleviates ALS symptoms, although Ruminococcus torques and Parabacteroides distasonis aggravate them.

"At the end of this chapter, it is worth mentioning the fact that the interaction between the microbiome and the host is bidirectional, and some metabolic changes, which could be a pathological result of disease progression, also influence microbiome metabolism. A good example is a disturbance in cholesterol homeostasis, which correlates with an augmented probability of Alzheimer's disease occurrence. In addition, alteration of the intestinal microbiota composition with the subsequent fluctuations in the serum and brain levels of bile acids (BAs) is involved in the development of AD. BAs can act as detergents, affecting BBB permeability, and incrementing brain influx of peripheral cholesterol and BAs. Therefore, proper cholesterol elimination pathways play a crucial role in AD prevention and treatment. The gut microbiome is a main ""organ"" metabolizing secondary bile acids. Peripheral cholesterol is eliminated mainly through its liver conversion to BAs. The gut microbiota performs BA transformation via deconjugation and dehydroxylation, leading to secondary BA formation. Nho et al. investigated the correlation between neurodegeneration and BAs, B-amyloid, and tau protein concentration. The application of targeted metabolomics enabled the determination of the association between intestinal microbiota-derived secondary bile acids and sera BAs. Interestingly, the analysis indicated an imbalanced BA ratio, underlying an increased amount of secondary BAs over primary ones. Another clinical study confirmed the correlation between bile acid metabolic profile and the prevalence of AD and mild cognitive impairment, showing similar BA ratio disruptions. Decreased cognitive functions were positively associated with increased concentrations of secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid, and glycolithocholic acid.

"It is currently controversial whether supplementation with BCAAs would increase circulating BCAAs, thereby increasing the risk of diabetes. And reducing BCAAs intake promotes fat mass loss and insulin sensitivity in mice with obesity. A high BCAAs diet causes excessive feeding, mainly due to excessive appetite. Adding threonine to balance the composition of amino acids in the diet can inhibit food intake. Nevertheless, some studies have found that supplementary BCAAs, such as isoleucine and leucine, can improve insulin resistance and reduce weight to lower the risk of obesity and diabetes. The inconsistency may be due to the individual state of energy excess or energy deficiency. In terms of an excessive energy state, such as in patients with obesity or diabetes who have an impaired ability to degrade BCAAs, BCAAs and related metabolites accumulate in circulation to reduce insulin sensitivity and cause insulin resistance. In most elderly people with inadequate energy or athletes who maintain good fitness habits, BCAAs can improve the form of metabolism. In these people, BCAAs decomposition metabolism is increased by regulatory factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha coactivator (PGC-1alpha) and PPARalpha, so that BCAAs levels are maintained in a steady state, which ultimately promotes glucose intake and insulin sensitivity. This was supported by the study of Newgard, who pointed out that dietary intake of BCAAs might interact with a high-fat diet to induce abnormal metabolic phenotypes such as insulin resistance. Mice fed BCAAs alone did not develop insulin resistance. However, when mice were fed a high-fat diet supplemented with BCAAs, they developed insulin resistance. This study suggested that BCAAs only lead to insulin resistance in the presence of excess energy intake. Therefore, more studies are needed to explore the supplementation with BCAAs and insulin resistance as well as the development of cardiovascular risk factors.",19341206.0,2446,2464,BCAAs,92.0,97.0,Chemical,130.0,138.0,diabetes,Disease,complicates
"Recently, bacterial strains producing SCFAs have gained extreme popularity. SCFAs are small organic monocarboxylic acids, released after the fermentation of indigestible alimentary fiber (mainly galacto- or fructooligosaccharides), plant-derived polysaccharides, or the metabolism of amino acids, and are considered a key gut-derived metabolites with beneficial health effects and as essential in gut-brain crosstalk. The type of formed SCFAs is correlated with the kind of fiber ingested and the overall gut microbiota population. For example, microbes belonging to Firmicutes phyla (e.g., Lachnospiraceae, Eubacterium, or Roseburia belonging to the Clostridia class) are responsible for the main production of butyrate, whereas Bifidobacteria spp. produce lactate and acetate. SCFAs are significantly reduced during dysbiosis, where disrupted gut epithelial integrity, inflammation, and altered microbiome metabolic processes occur. In a healthy colon, levels of SCFAs can vary depending on a diet; however, in multiple diseases, these levels are altered. SCFAs may also act in an indirect or direct way through G-protein-coupled receptors or as histone deacetylase epigenetic modulators. They participate in various physiological processes, such as cell energetics and colonocyte metabolism and skeletal, adipose, and liver tissue modulation.

"Previous results have indicated that the metabolic regulation of BAs may be associated with T2D but the specific changes in BAs and the related mechanisms remain to be studied. It is also unclear how the different types of BAs change in patients with T2D. A study also suggested that patients with T2D had no change in plasma total BAs, but had an increase in DCA and a decrease in CDCA in plasma. Another study found that the plasma total BA concentration in patients with T2D was not significantly different from that of healthy people; however, the concentration of DCA in the plasma of patients with T2D was significantly higher than that of healthy controls. The mechanism may be that FXR and TGR5 are inhibited during insulin resistance, and the most effective natural ligands of the receptors, DCA and CA, are compensatorily increased. Besides, circulating BAs levels including DCA, TCA, TDCA, and glycodeoxycholic acid, are positively associated with the risk of T2D, while taurohyodeoxycholic acid is negatively associated with diabetes.

"Mechanically, current studies suggest that SCFAs may exert their functions through acting as energy substrates and maintaining metabolic integration by a variety of different downstream regulatory mechanisms, such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPRs) with GPR41/Recombinant Free Fatty Acid Receptor (FFAR3), GPR43/FFAR2, GPR109A, Olfactory Receptors 78 (Olfr78) in endocrine cells of the gut wall, as well as histone deacetylases (HDACs) (Fig. 2). GPR41 regulates host energy acquisition and promotes the catabolism of glucose and lipids. The decreased SCFAs may cause less activated GPR41 and higher levels of energy uptake. In addition, it has also been reported that the lower production of SCFAs in gut microbiota would increase the host's capability of obtaining energy from the diet. SCFAs from bacterial fermentation promote the secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY) through GPR43 and GPR41 from intestinal L cells. GLP-1 increased pancreatic insulin secretion, and inhibited the production of glucagon. Deletion of GLP-1 abolished the beneficial effects of prebiotics on weight gain, glucose metabolism, and inflammatory pathway activation.

"At the end of this chapter, it is worth mentioning the fact that the interaction between the microbiome and the host is bidirectional, and some metabolic changes, which could be a pathological result of disease progression, also influence microbiome metabolism. A good example is a disturbance in cholesterol homeostasis, which correlates with an augmented probability of Alzheimer's disease occurrence. In addition, alteration of the intestinal microbiota composition with the subsequent fluctuations in the serum and brain levels of bile acids (BAs) is involved in the development of AD. BAs can act as detergents, affecting BBB permeability, and incrementing brain influx of peripheral cholesterol and BAs. Therefore, proper cholesterol elimination pathways play a crucial role in AD prevention and treatment. The gut microbiome is a main ""organ"" metabolizing secondary bile acids. Peripheral cholesterol is eliminated mainly through its liver conversion to BAs. The gut microbiota performs BA transformation via deconjugation and dehydroxylation, leading to secondary BA formation. Nho et al. investigated the correlation between neurodegeneration and BAs, B-amyloid, and tau protein concentration. The application of targeted metabolomics enabled the determination of the association between intestinal microbiota-derived secondary bile acids and sera BAs. Interestingly, the analysis indicated an imbalanced BA ratio, underlying an increased amount of secondary BAs over primary ones. Another clinical study confirmed the correlation between bile acid metabolic profile and the prevalence of AD and mild cognitive impairment, showing similar BA ratio disruptions. Decreased cognitive functions were positively associated with increased concentrations of secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid, and glycolithocholic acid.

"Recently, bacterial strains producing SCFAs have gained extreme popularity. SCFAs are small organic monocarboxylic acids, released after the fermentation of indigestible alimentary fiber (mainly galacto- or fructooligosaccharides), plant-derived polysaccharides, or the metabolism of amino acids, and are considered a key gut-derived metabolites with beneficial health effects and as essential in gut-brain crosstalk. The type of formed SCFAs is correlated with the kind of fiber ingested and the overall gut microbiota population. For example, microbes belonging to Firmicutes phyla (e.g., Lachnospiraceae, Eubacterium, or Roseburia belonging to the Clostridia class) are responsible for the main production of butyrate, whereas Bifidobacteria spp. produce lactate and acetate. SCFAs are significantly reduced during dysbiosis, where disrupted gut epithelial integrity, inflammation, and altered microbiome metabolic processes occur. In a healthy colon, levels of SCFAs can vary depending on a diet; however, in multiple diseases, these levels are altered. SCFAs may also act in an indirect or direct way through G-protein-coupled receptors or as histone deacetylase epigenetic modulators. They participate in various physiological processes, such as cell energetics and colonocyte metabolism and skeletal, adipose, and liver tissue modulation.

"The gut microbiome is crucially engaged in the regulation and maintenance of human health and homeostasis, i.e., proper intestine motion, fibre digestion, regulating the development of host immunity, and exerting a protective effect against pathogenic factors (such as Campylobacter jejuni, Helicobacter pylori, and Clostridium difficile). The Irish ELDERMET study (Elderly to benefit from Research Project) demonstrated the correlation between intestinal microbiota diversity and health outcomes such as overall health, frailty, and proper immune functions, underlying the gut microbiota composition as a possible indicator of healthy ageing. Multiple studies showed the interplay between the intestinal microbiota and modulation of central nervous system (CNS) functions and neurodegeneration processes, pointing to the microbiome-gut-brain axis as one of the factors modulating host homeostasis in health and disease. In the past decade, the alterations of the gut microbiota, which are called dysbiosis, have been connected with the pathophysiology of numerous common diseases such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, gastrointestinal diseases, and cardiovascular events. Dysbiosis state is also implicated in neurological and neurodegenerative disorders such as autism, and Alzheimer's (AD) or Parkinson's (PD) diseases.

"SCFAs may prevent obesity by regulating the homeostasis of glucose and lipid metabolism. For instance, acetate decreases appetite and nutrient intake. Propionate activates intestinal gluconeogenesis by a gut-brain neural circuit to promote energy balance. Butyrate provides energy for colon cells, maintains the integrity of intestinal walls, and improves the insulin response, which activates gluconeogenesis to maintain the balance of glucose and energy through the cAMP pathway. And one study indicated that oral butyrate intake prevents obesity and insulin resistance. Furthermore, the role of SCFAs in metabolic hemostasis is related to other factors. Adenosine monophosphate activating protein (AMPK) is a heterotrimeric enzyme that stimulates liver and muscle fatty acid oxidation pathways. SCFAs promote the activity of AMPK and improve its ability to oxidize fatty acids. Last, SCFAs can affect the development of dyslipidemia. SCFAs increase the expression of fasting-induced adipose factor (FIAF), a circulating lipoprotein lipase inhibitor, by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-gamma), thereby decreasing the activity of lipoproteinases and inhibiting lipolysis in adipose tissues.

"It is currently controversial whether supplementation with BCAAs would increase circulating BCAAs, thereby increasing the risk of diabetes. And reducing BCAAs intake promotes fat mass loss and insulin sensitivity in mice with obesity. A high BCAAs diet causes excessive feeding, mainly due to excessive appetite. Adding threonine to balance the composition of amino acids in the diet can inhibit food intake. Nevertheless, some studies have found that supplementary BCAAs, such as isoleucine and leucine, can improve insulin resistance and reduce weight to lower the risk of obesity and diabetes. The inconsistency may be due to the individual state of energy excess or energy deficiency. In terms of an excessive energy state, such as in patients with obesity or diabetes who have an impaired ability to degrade BCAAs, BCAAs and related metabolites accumulate in circulation to reduce insulin sensitivity and cause insulin resistance. In most elderly people with inadequate energy or athletes who maintain good fitness habits, BCAAs can improve the form of metabolism. In these people, BCAAs decomposition metabolism is increased by regulatory factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha coactivator (PGC-1alpha) and PPARalpha, so that BCAAs levels are maintained in a steady state, which ultimately promotes glucose intake and insulin sensitivity. This was supported by the study of Newgard, who pointed out that dietary intake of BCAAs might interact with a high-fat diet to induce abnormal metabolic phenotypes such as insulin resistance. Mice fed BCAAs alone did not develop insulin resistance. However, when mice were fed a high-fat diet supplemented with BCAAs, they developed insulin resistance. This study suggested that BCAAs only lead to insulin resistance in the presence of excess energy intake.

"Several studies have suggested that different BAs profiles are closely related to obesity.

Mice with higher levels of non-12-OH BAs gained weight slowly and had less metabolic disturbance, while the rapidly gaining weight mice had significantly lower levels of non-12-OH BAs such as UDCA. UDCA intake significantly reduced weight gain and metabolic disturbances induced by high-fat diet. Another study also provided evidence that a high-fat diet caused obesity by increasing the levels of 12-OH BAs. In a rat model, high-fat diet caused increases in the total BAs, DCA and taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA) in plasma and liver tissues, and increases in DCA in intestinal tissues and feces.

In patients with CVDs and corresponding risk factors, the composition and ratio of gut microbiota have significant differences compared with their healthy counterparts. Therefore, gut microbiota dysbiosis, gut microbiota-generated metabolites, and the related signaling pathway may serve as explanations for some of the mechanisms about the occurrence and development of CVDs.

"It remains unclear how the gut microbiota and BAs profiles interact with each other and whether the interaction is associated with obesity. Mice fed BAs exhibited obesity and a composition change in the obesity-associated gut microbiota, which is similar to high-fat diet-fed mice. Under a high-fat diet, the concentration of intestinal BAs increases, and the composition of gut microbiota alternates. For example, the increased BAs are the main reason for the marked increase in the abundance of the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. Another study has shown that BAs and a high-fat diet promote the growth of Bilophila wadsworthia in mice, and secondary BAs produced by Bilophila spp. have been shown to induce obesity. What's more, it has been reported that the low capacity of microbiota to metabolize Tauro-beta-muricholic acid, a primary BA, might increase the risk of obesity and insulin resistance.

The Irish ELDERMET study (Elderly to benefit from Research Project) demonstrated the correlation between intestinal microbiota diversity and health outcomes such as overall health, frailty, and proper immune functions, underlying the gut microbiota composition as a possible indicator of healthy ageing. Multiple studies showed the interplay between the intestinal microbiota and modulation of central nervous system (CNS) functions and neurodegeneration processes, pointing to the microbiome-gut-brain axis as one of the factors modulating host homeostasis in health and disease. In the past decade, the alterations of the gut microbiota, which are called dysbiosis, have been connected with the pathophysiology of numerous common diseases such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, gastrointestinal diseases, and cardiovascular events. Dysbiosis state is also implicated in neurological and neurodegenerative disorders such as autism, and Alzheimer's (AD) or Parkinson's (PD) diseases.

"Given that the gut microbiota is essential in human health, changes in the composition and function of the gut microbiota may result in the development of diseases. Due to the influence of host genes, diet, antibiotic use, lifestyle, drugs as well as other factors, the composition and diversity of gut microbiota gradually change with interindividual variation. For example, a high-fat diet leads to an increase in the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. When the composition and proportion of gut microbiota change, inflammation and metabolic abnormalities can be induced, which contribute to the development of different diseases. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota refers to changes in the number, species and composition of gut microbiota. In recent years, gut microbiota dysbiosis has been shown to be critically involved in health and has emerged as a potential pathogenesis for various diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, cancers, and CVDs. Moreover, gut dysbiosis is also a driver of metabolic inflammation and metabolic dysregulation, which serve as a key feature of metabolic diseases. For instance, the translocation of intestinal bacteria to the blood and liver through the portal venous system together with its metabolites are able to stimulate the release of inflammatory factors, and promote the occurrence of non-alcoholic fatty liver as well as hepatitis.

The structural components of gut microbiota such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), flagella, and peptidoglycan, can interact with receptors on human cells to stimulate and guide the host immune response. For instance, LPS binds to Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, flagella binds to TLR5, and peptidoglycan binds to TLR2, triggering the expression of a large number of downstream inflammatory factors, thereby affecting the cardiovascular system.

"Previous results have indicated that the metabolic regulation of BAs may be associated with T2D but the specific changes in BAs and the related mechanisms remain to be studied.

Another study found that the plasma total BA concentration in patients with T2D was not significantly different from that of healthy people; however, the concentration of DCA in the plasma of patients with T2D was significantly higher than that of healthy controls. The mechanism may be that FXR and TGR5 are inhibited during insulin resistance, and the most effective natural ligands of the receptors, DCA and CA, are compensatorily increased. Besides, circulating BAs levels including DCA, TCA, TDCA, and glycodeoxycholic acid, are positively associated with the risk of T2D, while taurohyodeoxycholic acid is negatively associated with diabetes.

"In summary, the gut microbiota generates a series of bioactive metabolites to interact with host metabolism. These metabolites mainly include SCFAs, primary and secondary BAs, TMAO, and so on. Among these metabolites, some exert synergistic effects to promote host health by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system to control glucose metabolism. For example, SCFAs interact with human hormones such as GLP-1 and PYY to effect energy uptake and the development of obesity. SCFAs are beneficial for regulating appetite and energy intake, and preventing the formation of atherosclerosis. Other metabolites, such as TMAO and phenylacetylglutamine (PAGln), may be toxic. For example, TMAO may be proatherogenic to promote the process of thrombosis and atherosclerosis, thereby increasing the risk of cardiovascular events. Patients with CVDs had lower levels of SCFA generation and higher levels of TMAO production due to the change in gut microbiota. Furthermore, TMAO causes vascular endothelial damage and promotes the production of atherosclerotic plaques. TMAO can also increase the release of intracellular calcium ions, enhance the reactivity of platelets, and increase the risk of thrombosis to increase CVDs susceptibility. Besides, PAGln enhances platelet reactivity and thrombosis, leading to CVDs.

The increased BCAAs-induced insulin resistance was associated with the presence of Prevotella copri and Bacteroides vulgatus. The major groups of gut bacteria that biosynthesize BCAAs are Prevotella copri and Bacteroides vulgatus, and the insulin resistance caused by elevated BCAAs levels is associated with the presence of these two bacteria.

"It is currently controversial whether supplementation with BCAAs would increase circulating BCAAs, thereby increasing the risk of diabetes. And reducing BCAAs intake promotes fat mass loss and insulin sensitivity in mice with obesity. A high BCAAs diet causes excessive feeding, mainly due to excessive appetite. Adding threonine to balance the composition of amino acids in the diet can inhibit food intake. Nevertheless, some studies have found that supplementary BCAAs, such as isoleucine and leucine, can improve insulin resistance and reduce weight to lower the risk of obesity and diabetes. The inconsistency may be due to the individual state of energy excess or energy deficiency. In terms of an excessive energy state, such as in patients with obesity or diabetes who have an impaired ability to degrade BCAAs, BCAAs and related metabolites accumulate in circulation to reduce insulin sensitivity and cause insulin resistance. In most elderly people with inadequate energy or athletes who maintain good fitness habits, BCAAs can improve the form of metabolism. In these people, BCAAs decomposition metabolism is increased by regulatory factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha coactivator (PGC-1alpha) and PPARalpha, so that BCAAs levels are maintained in a steady state, which ultimately promotes glucose intake and insulin sensitivity. This was supported by the study of Newgard, who pointed out that dietary intake of BCAAs might interact with a high-fat diet to induce abnormal metabolic phenotypes such as insulin resistance. Mice fed BCAAs alone did not develop insulin resistance. However, when mice were fed a high-fat diet supplemented with BCAAs, they developed insulin resistance. This study suggested that BCAAs only lead to insulin resistance in the presence of excess energy intake.

"Aromatic amino acids including tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine are metabolized into indole and phenols by certain intestinal anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, and Peptostreptococcus. Tryptophan is decomposed into indole, indoleacetic acid, indole-3-lactic acid, 3-methylindole (skatole) and other indole compounds under the action of tryptophanase. Tryptophanase is the key enzyme that generates indole. The activity of the enzyme is easily induced by the substrate tryptophan, so when the amount of tryptophan changes in the colonic environment, the content of indole will fluctuate greatly. Of note, the metabolic products of aromatic amino acids generated by gut microbiota have a great impact on the pathology of cardiometabolic diseases. For example, indole propionic acid is associated with insulin sensitivity and appears to reduce the risk of diabetes. Moreover, the gut microbiota metabolizes dietary tryptophan to indoxyl, which further generates indoxyl sulfate through sulfonation. Excessive accumulation of indoxyl sulfate causes cardiomyocyte damage and increases thrombus formation. Another phenol compound, 4-methylphenol, can inhibit the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into mature adipocytes, induce apoptosis and reduce glucose uptake.

Moreover, it can be recognized as a characteristic indicator of PD neural degeneration. This protein aggregate can boost the local immune response. Interestingly, alpha-synuclein deposition has been confirmed in the neurons of the intestinal submucosa, together with a possibility of the alpha-synuclein transport to the brain via the vagus nerve (translocation of prion-like proteins). Misfolded alpha-synuclein triggers neuronal dysfunction and progressive degeneration, thereby enabling disease progression.

SCFAs are small organic monocarboxylic acids, released after the fermentation of indigestible alimentary fiber (mainly galacto- or fructooligosaccharides), plant-derived polysaccharides, or the metabolism of amino acids, and are considered a key gut-derived metabolites with beneficial health effects and as essential in gut-brain crosstalk. The type of formed SCFAs is correlated with the kind of fiber ingested and the overall gut microbiota population. For example, microbes belonging to Firmicutes phyla (e.g., Lachnospiraceae, Eubacterium, or Roseburia belonging to the Clostridia class) are responsible for the main production of butyrate, whereas Bifidobacteria spp. produce lactate and acetate. SCFAs are significantly reduced during dysbiosis, where disrupted gut epithelial integrity, inflammation, and altered microbiome metabolic processes occur. In a healthy colon, levels of SCFAs can vary depending on a diet; however, in multiple diseases, these levels are altered. SCFAs may also act in an indirect or direct way through G-protein-coupled receptors or as histone deacetylase epigenetic modulators. They participate in various physiological processes, such as cell energetics and colonocyte metabolism and skeletal, adipose, and liver tissue modulation. Their major functions comprise the activation of trophic factors, energy management, and the manufacturing of regulatory T-cells. Short-chain fatty acids can be considered as key intermediaries in numerous neurological diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, stroke, and neuropsychiatric conditions.",16409429.0,s_Why9dAoi,bW1rr_6RTr,Lachnospiraceae,591.0,606.0,Species,567.0,583.0,Firmicutes phyla,Species,part_of
"TMAO has been mechanistically linked to atherosclerosis and is also proposed as a promotor and predictor of clinical vascular events in CAD. Plasma TMAO levels are associated with long-term risks of cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndrome, at least in particular related to its pro-inflammatory capacity, promoting the adhesion ability of aortic endothelial cells. In mechanism, TMAO enhances platelet hyperreactivity by altering Ca2+ signaling and elicits a pro-thrombotic effect. Especially, TMAO seems to induce systemic inflammation that contributes to CAD progression. This is particularly relevant given that TMAO directly activates inflammatory pathways, and elicits perturbations in membrane dynamics in human aortic ECs and smooth muscle cells. In particular, the exosomes secreted by TMAO-stimulated hepatocytes increase the secretion of TNF-alpha and IL-6, and further promote inflammation.",18896134.0,3398,yT00ElLhtU,TMAO,517.0,521.0,Chemical,538.0,559.0,systemic inflammation,Disease,causes

"However host-microbiota interplay is not exclusively restricted to cell-cell interactions. Intestinal microbes are capable of producing a plethora of different types of compounds, i.e., small molecules (amino acids, neurotransmitters, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and other fatty acid derivatives, indoles, vitamins, and cofactors), polysaccharides, and proteins (i.e., bacteriocins), which have been reported as important factors in shaping the bacterial community and modulation of the immune system. It has been demonstrated that intestinal bacterial strains such as Escherichia coli or Lactobacillus spp. interact directly with the host's CNS (central nervous system), as they can release neurotransmitters such as dopamine, noradrenaline, histamine, acetylcholine, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), or serotonin. This metabolic status of the microbiome is also vulnerable to dysbiosis and compositional changes and often leads to metabolic disturbances. For example, dysbiosis can induce elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, intensifying oxidative stress and neuronal inflammatory processes. It has been estimated that 40% of the metabolites detected in humans are the products of bacterial metabolism, which plays a fundamental role in the modulation of the host's physiological processes, including immune-mediated neurodegeneration or affecting neural cell metabolism.",16115776.0,129,DXaV1U0Gwi,Lactobacillus,593.0,606.0,Species,696.0,713.0,neurotransmitters,Chemical,start

"It is well investigated that BCAAs have a significant positive correlation with blood glucose, blood lipids, and the insulin resistance index, and can be used as potential biomarkers for the early prediction of diabetes. One study indicated that three BCAAs (leucine, isoleucine, and valine), and two aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine and tyrosine) were significantly increased 10 years before the onset of diabetes. The increased BCAAs-induced insulin resistance was associated with the presence of Prevotella copri and Bacteroides vulgatus. The major groups of gut bacteria that biosynthesize BCAAs are Prevotella copri and Bacteroides vulgatus, and the insulin resistance caused by elevated BCAAs levels is associated with the presence of these two bacteria.

"The main end product of bacterial fermentation, and therefore the most predominant, is the SCFA propionic acid (PA), which positively influences CNS regeneration processes such as remyelination (due to the former increase of the amount of intestinal T regulatory cells and protecting against the white matter and axonal loss). Hoyles et al. demonstrated the contribution of propionate to the BBB integrity and the modulation of gut-brain axis. BBB homeostasis and integrity are necessary for proper CNS development and function. Recently, a positive correlation between microbial-induced BBB dysfunction (barrier integrity disturbances followed by leakage) and disorders such as AD has been established. Another member of the SCFAs family, which has a documented influence on homeostasis and AD progression, is butyrate, an important driver of metabolic processes with the ability to influence intestinal macrophages, increasing immunomodulation and decreasing the histone deacetylase inhibition-mediated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Butyrate, as an SCFA, influences the immune response crossing the BBB and drives the maturation and metabolism of microglia cells. It regulates the secretion of gut hormones, such as glucagon-like peptide-1, which can improve hippocampus neuroplasticity. Additionally, in vitro tests conducted by Ho et al. revealed that bacterial SCFAs, such as valeric and butyric acid, exhibited a strong inhibitory effect on amyloid-beta aggregation, which can be absorbed in the intestines and have a negative influence on disease progression.",16144118.0,438,444,PA,112.0,114.0,Chemical,180.0,193.0,remyelination,Disease,increase

A study also suggested that patients with T2D had no change in plasma total BAs, but had an increase in DCA and a decrease in CDCA in plasma. Another study found that the plasma total BA concentration in patients with T2D was not significantly different from that of healthy people; however, the concentration of DCA in the plasma of patients with T2D was significantly higher than that of healthy controls. The mechanism may be that FXR and TGR5 are inhibited during insulin resistance, and the most effective natural ligands of the receptors, DCA and CA, are compensatorily increased. Besides, circulating BAs levels including DCA, TCA, TDCA, and glycodeoxycholic acid, are positively associated with the risk of T2D, while taurohyodeoxycholic acid is negatively associated with diabetes.

"In summary, the gut microbiota generates a series of bioactive metabolites to interact with host metabolism. These metabolites mainly include SCFAs, primary and secondary BAs, TMAO, and so on. Among these metabolites, some exert synergistic effects to promote host health by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system to control glucose metabolism. For example, SCFAs interact with human hormones such as GLP-1 and PYY to effect energy uptake and the development of obesity. SCFAs are beneficial for regulating appetite and energy intake, and preventing the formation of atherosclerosis. Other metabolites, such as TMAO and phenylacetylglutamine (PAGln), may be toxic. For example, TMAO may be proatherogenic to promote the process of thrombosis and atherosclerosis, thereby increasing the risk of cardiovascular events. Patients with CVDs had lower levels of SCFA generation and higher levels of TMAO production due to the change in gut microbiota. Furthermore, TMAO causes vascular endothelial damage and promotes the production of atherosclerotic plaques. TMAO can also increase the release of intracellular calcium ions, enhance the reactivity of platelets, and increase the risk of thrombosis to increase CVDs susceptibility.

"Recently, bacterial strains producing SCFAs have gained extreme popularity. SCFAs are small organic monocarboxylic acids, released after the fermentation of indigestible alimentary fiber (mainly galacto- or fructooligosaccharides), plant-derived polysaccharides, or the metabolism of amino acids, and are considered a key gut-derived metabolites with beneficial health effects and as essential in gut-brain crosstalk. The type of formed SCFAs is correlated with the kind of fiber ingested and the overall gut microbiota population. For example, microbes belonging to Firmicutes phyla (e.g., Lachnospiraceae, Eubacterium, or Roseburia belonging to the Clostridia class) are responsible for the main production of butyrate, whereas Bifidobacteria spp. produce lactate and acetate. SCFAs are significantly reduced during dysbiosis, where disrupted gut epithelial integrity, inflammation, and altered microbiome metabolic processes occur. In a healthy colon, levels of SCFAs can vary depending on a diet; however, in multiple diseases, these levels are altered. SCFAs may also act in an indirect or direct way through G-protein-coupled receptors or as histone deacetylase epigenetic modulators.

"Previous results have indicated that the metabolic regulation of BAs may be associated with T2D but the specific changes in BAs and the related mechanisms remain to be studied. It is also unclear how the different types of BAs change in patients with T2D. A study also suggested that patients with T2D had no change in plasma total BAs, but had an increase in DCA and a decrease in CDCA in plasma. Another study found that the plasma total BA concentration in patients with T2D was not significantly different from that of healthy people; however, the concentration of DCA in the plasma of patients with T2D was significantly higher than that of healthy controls. The mechanism may be that FXR and TGR5 are inhibited during insulin resistance, and the most effective natural ligands of the receptors, DCA and CA, are compensatorily increased. Besides, circulating BAs levels including DCA, TCA, TDCA, and glycodeoxycholic acid, are positively associated with the risk of T2D, while taurohyodeoxycholic acid is negatively associated with diabetes.

"SCFAs may prevent obesity by regulating the homeostasis of glucose and lipid metabolism. For instance, acetate decreases appetite and nutrient intake. Propionate activates intestinal gluconeogenesis by a gut-brain neural circuit to promote energy balance. Butyrate provides energy for colon cells, maintains the integrity of intestinal walls, and improves the insulin response, which activates gluconeogenesis to maintain the balance of glucose and energy through the cAMP pathway. And one study indicated that oral butyrate intake prevents obesity and insulin resistance. Furthermore, the role of SCFAs in metabolic hemostasis is related to other factors. Adenosine monophosphate activating protein (AMPK) is a heterotrimeric enzyme that stimulates liver and muscle fatty acid oxidation pathways. SCFAs promote the activity of AMPK and improve its ability to oxidize fatty acids. Last, SCFAs can affect the development of dyslipidemia. SCFAs increase the expression of fasting-induced adipose factor (FIAF), a circulating lipoprotein lipase inhibitor, by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-gamma), thereby decreasing the activity of lipoproteinases and inhibiting lipolysis in adipose tissues.

"Given that the gut microbiota is essential in human health, changes in the composition and function of the gut microbiota may result in the development of diseases. Due to the influence of host genes, diet, antibiotic use, lifestyle, drugs as well as other factors, the composition and diversity of gut microbiota gradually change with interindividual variation. For example, a high-fat diet leads to an increase in the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. When the composition and proportion of gut microbiota change, inflammation and metabolic abnormalities can be induced, which contribute to the development of different diseases. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota refers to changes in the number, species and composition of gut microbiota. In recent years, gut microbiota dysbiosis has been shown to be critically involved in health and has emerged as a potential pathogenesis for various diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, cancers, and CVDs. Moreover, gut dysbiosis is also a driver of metabolic inflammation and metabolic dysregulation, which serve as a key feature of metabolic diseases. For instance, the translocation of intestinal bacteria to the blood and liver through the portal venous system together with its metabolites are able to stimulate the release of inflammatory factors, and promote the occurrence of non-alcoholic fatty liver as well as hepatitis.

"It is currently controversial whether supplementation with BCAAs would increase circulating BCAAs, thereby increasing the risk of diabetes. And reducing BCAAs intake promotes fat mass loss and insulin sensitivity in mice with obesity. A high BCAAs diet causes excessive feeding, mainly due to excessive appetite. Adding threonine to balance the composition of amino acids in the diet can inhibit food intake. Nevertheless, some studies have found that supplementary BCAAs, such as isoleucine and leucine, can improve insulin resistance and reduce weight to lower the risk of obesity and diabetes. The inconsistency may be due to the individual state of energy excess or energy deficiency. In terms of an excessive energy state, such as in patients with obesity or diabetes who have an impaired ability to degrade BCAAs, BCAAs and related metabolites accumulate in circulation to reduce insulin sensitivity and cause insulin resistance. In most elderly people with inadequate energy or athletes who maintain good fitness habits, BCAAs can improve the form of metabolism. In these people, BCAAs decomposition metabolism is increased by regulatory factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha coactivator (PGC-1alpha) and PPARalpha, so that BCAAs levels are maintained in a steady state, which ultimately promotes glucose intake and insulin sensitivity. This was supported by the study of Newgard, who pointed out that dietary intake of BCAAs might interact with a high-fat diet to induce abnormal metabolic phenotypes such as insulin resistance. Mice fed BCAAs alone did not develop insulin resistance. However, when mice were fed a high-fat diet supplemented with BCAAs, they developed insulin resistance. This study suggested that BCAAs only lead to insulin resistance in the presence of excess energy intake. Therefore, more studies are needed to explore the supplementation with BCAAs and insulin resistance as well as the development of cardiovascular risk factors.",19341206.0,2488,2489,insulin,517.0,524.0,Gene,193.0,200.0,insulin,Gene,None
"Multiple sclerosis is a chronic neurodegenerative autoimmune disorder, where the human immune system attacks the myelin sheath surrounding axon terminals, thereby triggering long-lasting inflammation within the CNS, abrasion formation, and demyelination of axons. Besides, afterward, it can cause autonomic and cognitive problems, motor, sensory, and visual flaws, and finally paralysis and disruption of the BBB. Various animal and human studies suggested the participation of gut microbiota in the development of MS. Animal studies on an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mice model revealed a significant reduction in Lactobacillus phyla, contributing to an impairment of the mice's immune systems. In patients diagnosed with MS, a reduction in the variety and quantity of gut bacteria was detected, confirming a moderate dysbiosis state. Fecal samples obtained from MS patients indicated the reduced amount of bacteria belonging to 19 species, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Faecalibacterium, Prevotella, and Anaerostipes species among them, and the increased quantity of Actinobacteria, Bifidobacterium, and Streptococcus genera.",16208798.0,1188,1AVhCWVZiK,Multiple sclerosis,0.0,18.0,Disease,216.0,234.0,abrasion formation,Disease,causes
"At the end of this chapter, it is worth mentioning the fact that the interaction between the microbiome and the host is bidirectional, and some metabolic changes, which could be a pathological result of disease progression, also influence microbiome metabolism. A good example is a disturbance in cholesterol homeostasis, which correlates with an augmented probability of Alzheimer's disease occurrence. In addition, alteration of the intestinal microbiota composition with the subsequent fluctuations in the serum and brain levels of bile acids (BAs) is involved in the development of AD. BAs can act as detergents, affecting BBB permeability, and incrementing brain influx of peripheral cholesterol and BAs. Therefore, proper cholesterol elimination pathways play a crucial role in AD prevention and treatment. The gut microbiome is a main ""organ"" metabolizing secondary bile acids. Peripheral cholesterol is eliminated mainly through its liver conversion to BAs. The gut microbiota performs BA transformation via deconjugation and dehydroxylation, leading to secondary BA formation. Nho et al. investigated the correlation between neurodegeneration and BAs, B-amyloid, and tau protein concentration. The application of targeted metabolomics enabled the determination of the association between intestinal microbiota-derived secondary bile acids and sera BAs. Interestingly, the analysis indicated an imbalanced BA ratio, underlying an increased amount of secondary BAs over primary ones. Another clinical study confirmed the correlation between bile acid metabolic profile and the prevalence of AD and mild cognitive impairment, showing similar BA ratio disruptions. Decreased cognitive functions were positively associated with increased concentrations of secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid, and glycolithocholic acid. The described results suggested the involvement of the pathological gut microbiota in AD development; however, still it requires more in-depth studies.",16559364.0,tQ6k6CfO2e,770,BBB,627.0,630.0,Cellline,689.0,700.0,cholesterol,Chemical,affects

Only completed studies were taken into consideration. After the initial selection, we collected only those trials related to brain related/stress disorders (Table 2).

"Experimental research confirms the hypothesis regarding SCFA reduction in autoimmune diseases (MS among others) and altered gut microbiota. A low level of SCFAs dysregulates Treg cell functions, leading to insufficient immune tolerance towards endogenous components and enteric microbiota. However, this process can be reversed by SCFAs supplementation (e.g., propionic acid). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing NFkappaB activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation and on microglial cells in vitro. TUDCA binds to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) expressed in microglial cells. This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS). Experimental results demonstrated that TUDCA acted as a double-edged sword, triggering microglia enhancement in anti-inflammatory and alternatively activated markers and on the other hand reducing the infiltration of macrophages and microglia with expressed pro-inflammatory markers. Interestingly, during neuroinflammation, microglial cells change their morphology, converting themselves into reactive macrophage-like forms. However, microglial cells are flexible, as they can sometimes polarize towards alternatively activated phenotypes, promoting CNS pathologies (proinflammatory or M1 microglia), or exert anti-inflammatory effects, boosting cell repair and remodeling. Bile acids were identified as nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor agonists, leading to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) depletion (in a mouse model) and neuroinflammatory process adjustment. The administration of the complex probiotic positively influenced the intestinal flora balance in patients diagnosed with MS. The probiotic prevented the onset of dysbiosis, significantly increasing the amount of Methanobrevibacter and Akkermansia, Prevotella, and Sutterella in MS patients, influencing gene expression and the production of beneficial bacterial metabolites.",16224291.0,1279,-1XpLXk_mn,ursodeoxycholic acid,654.0,674.0,Chemical,608.0,646.0,CNS inflammatory signalling modulators,Chemical,part_of

"The PD microbiome has a diminished variety of bacterial taxonomic groups, especially the ones associated with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects and the increase of phyla, which has toxic effects. Predominantly, the reduction was observed in the Lachnospiraceae family, including Butyrivibrio, Pseudobutyrivibrio, Coprococcus, Blautia and SCFAs-producing Prevotellaceae. The increased amount of Enterobacteriaceae is linked to the severity of postural instability and walking difficulties. Moreover, the PD microbiome is characterised by increased Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium species and decreased amount of Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae. The overgrowth of Akkermansia spp. in PD patients may be strain-specific and can be related to immune-response alterations, decreased mucus thicknesses, and increased constipation. Faecalibacterium family is a crucial player producing SCFAs and anti-inflammatory metabolites, maintaining gut health. Faecalibacterium balance disturbances can lead to impaired gut-barrier function, increasing the risk of infection with enteric pathogens and boosting alpha-synuclein formation. Similarly, the Lachnospiraceae family can produce butyrate, important for the proper function of the gut epithelium. Decreased Lachnospiraceae quantity might aggravate gut inflammation, stimulate toxin production, and damage the integrity of the gut epithelial barrier. PD patients' intestinal microflora were characterised by a diminished abundance of Lachnospiraceae, which was positively correlated with PD progress, cognitive decline, and impaired motor functions. These microbiome's compositional changes correlate well with some metabolic switches. PD microbiota show reduced SCFAs production, decreased carbohydrate fermentation, and augmented proteolytic fermentation. Chen et al. demonstrated that the SCFA level was relevant to microbiota composition changes and the clinical severity of PD. The levels of SCFAs acetate, butyrate, and propionate in fecal samples of PD patients were significantly reduced, contrary to their elevated concentration in plasma. Rodent models of PD disease have shown a positive effect of SCFAs on behavior and PD symptoms. Butyrate, as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, exerts neuroprotective activity, reducing dopaminergic cell death, and motor impairment, and improving cognitive functions. Taken together, SCFAs play an important role in protection from PD disease and could be proposed as representative gut-oriented indicators for diversifying individuals with PD and placing disease progression.",16553034.0,993,979,PD,2014.0,2016.0,Disease,1983.0,1993.0,propionate,Chemical,decrease
"The health of the gut microbiome can vary depending on various factors including diet (e.g., ingestion of saturated/unsaturated dietary fats, vitamins, minerals, dairy products, alcoholic beverages, polyphenols containing food such as cocoa-rich chocolate, tea, or coffee), dietary patterns, geographical area, and diet-related habits (sometimes varying between males and females) and sex (the influence of sex hormones). A positive correlation between polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (N-3 PUFA), and alpha-linolenic acid (aLNA) ingestion and protection against PD development in dose-response trends was demonstrated. American studies demonstrated that PUFA replacement with increased animal fat intake (Western Diet) significantly increased the risk of PD in males only. Excessive animal fat intake can promote dysbiosis and the production of harmful microbial metabolites, which can increase the prevalence of the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, sex differences are implicated in the mental health and prevalence of psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, and neurodegenerative disorders. It has been demonstrated that PD patients usually have altered microbiome compositions compared with controls. Similar to AD, many sex differences in PD are correlated with the protective nature of estrogens, as they are impacted by the gut-brain axis and protect against oxidative damage, thereby supporting dopaminergic function. It has been demonstrated that at age 45, the estimated overall lifetime risk for AD is about 20% for females and 10% for males, which is followed by a disruption in the patient's gut microbiota composition. In summary, it is worth underlining the correlation between the gut microbiome, immune system and brain, mental health, and behavior.",16221004.0,Snb52iahjO,1850,dairy products,162.0,176.0,Chemical,18.0,32.0,gut microbiome,Species,affects

"Aromatic amino acids including tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine are metabolized into indole and phenols by certain intestinal anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, and Peptostreptococcus. Tryptophan is decomposed into indole, indoleacetic acid, indole-3-lactic acid, 3-methylindole (skatole) and other indole compounds under the action of tryptophanase. Tryptophanase is the key enzyme that generates indole. The activity of the enzyme is easily induced by the substrate tryptophan, so when the amount of tryptophan changes in the colonic environment, the content of indole will fluctuate greatly. Of note, the metabolic products of aromatic amino acids generated by gut microbiota have a great impact on the pathology of cardiometabolic diseases. For example, indole propionic acid is associated with insulin sensitivity and appears to reduce the risk of diabetes. Moreover, the gut microbiota metabolizes dietary tryptophan to indoxyl, which further generates indoxyl sulfate through sulfonation. Excessive accumulation of indoxyl sulfate causes cardiomyocyte damage and increases thrombus formation. Another phenol compound, 4-methylphenol, can inhibit the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into mature adipocytes, induce apoptosis and reduce glucose uptake. In addition, benzoic acid is an aromatic carboxylic acid synthesized by colonic microorganisms by metabolizing dietary aromatic compounds.

"Importantly, studies found that the occurrence of CVDs was also involved in the immune response mediated by the NLR family. For example, atherosclerotic plaques in LDLR-/- NOD 1/2-/- mice showed less lipid deposition and macrophage aggregation, suggesting that lack of NOD 1/2 may reduce the occurrence of atherosclerosis. Moreover, the peptidoglycan components in bacteria can bind to NOD1 and NOD2, which in turn mediate the occurrence of the inflammatory response, and further leads to atherosclerosis. Besides, inflammation induced by the NLRP3 inflammasome plays a role in the interaction between gut microbiota and cardiometabolic diseases. For instance, the NLRP3 deficient obese mice had altered composition of the gut microbiota, decreased TMAO and LPS levels, as well as downregulated hepatic steatosis and myocardial energy metabolism. Nevertheless, another study reported that NOD TLR4 -/- mice developed higher body weight, hyperlipidemia, severe insulin, and glucose intolerance, lower circulating SCFAs levels, higher levels of Bacteroidetes, lower levels of Firmicutes in the large intestine, as well as fewer SCFAs-associated gut microbiota, all of which may promote the development of insulin-deficient diabetes.",16855003.0,bfxz78nJB5,OZAHdydKPX,Bacteroidetes,1043.0,1056.0,Species,973.0,992.0,glucose intolerance,Disease,None

"The gut microbiota is critical to human health, such as digesting nutrients, forming the intestinal epithelial barrier, regulating immune function, producing vitamins and hormones, and producing metabolites to interact with the host.

In patients with CVDs and corresponding risk factors, the composition and ratio of gut microbiota have significant differences compared with their healthy counterparts. Therefore, gut microbiota dysbiosis, gut microbiota-generated metabolites, and the related signaling pathway may serve as explanations for some of the mechanisms about the occurrence and development of CVDs.

"Several studies have suggested that different BAs profiles are closely related to obesity.

"Insufficient dietary fiber intake is considered to be an important risk factor for diabetes. The decrease in the production of SCFAs counts for an important reason here. Modulation of dietary SCFAs is thought to reshape the gut microbiota in diabetes and ameliorate diabetes.

Butyrate could promote the secretion of postprandial insulin; and the increase in fecal propionic acid was associated with an increase in T2D risk. In oral glucose tolerance test, a high butyrate-producing microbiota was associated with an improved insulin response (indicating improved beta-cell function), and butyrate concentration was directly related to postprandial insulin sensitivity.

"Scientific evidence indicates that the metabolic status of microbiota exerts a more important role than the equilibrium between bacterial species. Microbial metabolites can act as positive modulators of the gut-brain-axis constituents, boosting the immune cells and exerting a positive/protective effect on neurodegenerative disease progression. On the other hand, disrupted equilibrium between microbial species often leads to specific switches in the microbial metabolome, which may be harmful and associated with neurodegenerative disease progression. For example, dysregulation of Gram-negative bacteria in the gastrointestinal area leads to the production of harmful metabolites (i.e., endo- and exotoxins, saccharides, and amyloids). Exotoxins, such as LPS, which have the ability to activate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, exert negative effects. LPS belongs to glycolipid molecules, mostly produced by Gram-negative bacterial strains. These molecules participate in the integrity maintenance of the bacterial outer-membrane permeability barrier, playing an important role in host-pathogen interplay. The overproduction of bacterial LPS can cause the activation of the macrophage-monocyte nod-like receptor P3 inflammasome, therefore stimulating the production of cytokines with pro-inflammatory activity, such as IL-18 or IL-1beta. LPS can be translocated and intensify neuroinflammatory diseases such as AD. Additionally, it was demonstrated that IL-1beta can decrease the phagocytic function of microglial cells, stimulating the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, and causing reduced synaptic plasticity and cognitive deterioration. These cytokines can induce microbiota dysregulation, increasing gut permeability and influencing gut bacteria diversity.",16508033.0,Gmxbrw-sKT,295,Microbial metabolites,147.0,168.0,Chemical,307.0,332.0,neurodegenerative disease,Disease,improve

"Importantly, studies found that the occurrence of CVDs was also involved in the immune response mediated by the NLR family. For example, atherosclerotic plaques in LDLR-/- NOD 1/2-/- mice showed less lipid deposition and macrophage aggregation, suggesting that lack of NOD 1/2 may reduce the occurrence of atherosclerosis. Moreover, the peptidoglycan components in bacteria can bind to NOD1 and NOD2, which in turn mediate the occurrence of the inflammatory response, and further leads to atherosclerosis. Besides, inflammation induced by the NLRP3 inflammasome plays a role in the interaction between gut microbiota and cardiometabolic diseases. For instance, the NLRP3 deficient obese mice had altered composition of the gut microbiota, decreased TMAO and LPS levels, as well as downregulated hepatic steatosis and myocardial energy metabolism. Nevertheless, another study reported that NOD TLR4 -/- mice developed higher body weight, hyperlipidemia, severe insulin, and glucose intolerance, lower circulating SCFAs levels, higher levels of Bacteroidetes, lower levels of Firmicutes in the large intestine, as well as fewer SCFAs-associated gut microbiota, all of which may promote the development of insulin-deficient diabetes.",16855003.0,388,375,NOD1,386.0,390.0,Gene,489.0,504.0,atherosclerosis,Disease,start

"Mechanically, current studies suggest that SCFAs may exert their functions through acting as energy substrates and maintaining metabolic integration by a variety of different downstream regulatory mechanisms, such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPRs) with GPR41/Recombinant Free Fatty Acid Receptor (FFAR3), GPR43/FFAR2, GPR109A, Olfactory Receptors 78 (Olfr78) in endocrine cells of the gut wall, as well as histone deacetylases (HDACs) (Fig. 2). GPR41 regulates host energy acquisition and promotes the catabolism of glucose and lipids. The decreased SCFAs may cause less activated GPR41 and higher levels of energy uptake. In addition, it has also been reported that the lower production of SCFAs in gut microbiota would increase the host's capability of obtaining energy from the diet. SCFAs from bacterial fermentation promote the secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY) through GPR43 and GPR41 from intestinal L cells. GLP-1 increased pancreatic insulin secretion, and inhibited the production of glucagon. Deletion of GLP-1 abolished the beneficial effects of prebiotics on weight gain, glucose metabolism, and inflammatory pathway activation. Moreover, PYY increases satiety, reduces food intake, inhibits intestinal motility, and increases the intestinal transit rate.",18395273.0,704,694,GPR41,449.0,454.0,Gene,520.0,527.0,glucose,Chemical,increase

Bacteroidetes are detected in children genetically predisposed to type 1 diabetes (T1D). Regarding T2D, patients were characterized by a decrease in several butyrate-producing bacteria and an increase in many opportunistic pathogens. For example, patients with T2D have reduced Clostridium butyricum in the gut, a main butyrate-producing bacteria. Lower concentrations of butyrate producing microbiota have been observed in fecal samples of patients with T2D. Moreover, Lactobacillus is positively correlated with fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels, while Clostridium is negatively correlated with fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels. Patients with T2D have significantly higher levels of Lactobacillus in fecal samples than healthy individuals.

"SCFAs may prevent obesity by regulating the homeostasis of glucose and lipid metabolism. For instance, acetate decreases appetite and nutrient intake. Propionate activates intestinal gluconeogenesis by a gut-brain neural circuit to promote energy balance. Butyrate provides energy for colon cells, maintains the integrity of intestinal walls, and improves the insulin response, which activates gluconeogenesis to maintain the balance of glucose and energy through the cAMP pathway. And one study indicated that oral butyrate intake prevents obesity and insulin resistance. Furthermore, the role of SCFAs in metabolic hemostasis is related to other factors. Adenosine monophosphate activating protein (AMPK) is a heterotrimeric enzyme that stimulates liver and muscle fatty acid oxidation pathways. SCFAs promote the activity of AMPK and improve its ability to oxidize fatty acids. Last, SCFAs can affect the development of dyslipidemia. SCFAs increase the expression of fasting-induced adipose factor (FIAF), a circulating lipoprotein lipase inhibitor, by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-gamma), thereby decreasing the activity of lipoproteinases and inhibiting lipolysis in adipose tissues.

"TMAO has been mechanistically linked to atherosclerosis and is also proposed as a promotor and predictor of clinical vascular events in CAD. Plasma TMAO levels are associated with long-term risks of cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndrome, at least in particular related to its pro-inflammatory capacity, promoting the adhesion ability of aortic endothelial cells. In mechanism, TMAO enhances platelet hyperreactivity by altering Ca2+ signaling and elicits a pro-thrombotic effect. Especially, TMAO seems to induce systemic inflammation that contributes to CAD progression. This is particularly relevant given that TMAO directly activates inflammatory pathways, and elicits perturbations in membrane dynamics in human aortic ECs and smooth muscle cells.

"Experimental research confirms the hypothesis regarding SCFA reduction in autoimmune diseases (MS among others) and altered gut microbiota. A low level of SCFAs dysregulates Treg cell functions, leading to insufficient immune tolerance towards endogenous components and enteric microbiota. However, this process can be reversed by SCFAs supplementation (e.g., propionic acid). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing NFkappaB activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation and on microglial cells in vitro. TUDCA binds to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) expressed in microglial cells. This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS). Experimental results demonstrated that TUDCA acted as a double-edged sword, triggering microglia enhancement in anti-inflammatory and alternatively activated markers and on the other hand reducing the infiltration of macrophages and microglia with expressed pro-inflammatory markers. Interestingly, during neuroinflammation, microglial cells change their morphology, converting themselves into reactive macrophage-like forms. However, microglial cells are flexible, as they can sometimes polarize towards alternatively activated phenotypes, promoting CNS pathologies (proinflammatory or M1 microglia), or exert anti-inflammatory effects, boosting cell repair and remodeling. Bile acids were identified as nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor agonists, leading to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) depletion (in a mouse model) and neuroinflammatory process adjustment. The administration of the complex probiotic positively influenced the intestinal flora balance in patients diagnosed with MS. The probiotic prevented the onset of dysbiosis, significantly increasing the amount of Methanobrevibacter and Akkermansia, Prevotella, and Sutterella in MS patients, influencing gene expression and the production of beneficial bacterial metabolites.",16224291.0,1302,pYwHIUfPkw,IRAK-M,1370.0,1376.0,Species,1285.0,1294.0,cytokines,Species,Associated_with

"It remains unclear how the gut microbiota and BAs profiles interact with each other and whether the interaction is associated with obesity. Mice fed BAs exhibited obesity and a composition change in the obesity-associated gut microbiota, which is similar to high-fat diet-fed mice. Under a high-fat diet, the concentration of intestinal BAs increases, and the composition of gut microbiota alternates. For example, the increased BAs are the main reason for the marked increase in the abundance of the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. Another study has shown that BAs and a high-fat diet promote the growth of Bilophila wadsworthia in mice, and secondary BAs produced by Bilophila spp. have been shown to induce obesity. What's more, it has been reported that the low capacity of microbiota to metabolize Tauro-beta-muricholic acid, a primary BA, might increase the risk of obesity and insulin resistance.

"The gut microbiome is crucially engaged in the regulation and maintenance of human health and homeostasis, i.e., proper intestine motion, fibre digestion, regulating the development of host immunity, and exerting a protective effect against pathogenic factors (such as Campylobacter jejuni, Helicobacter pylori, and Clostridium difficile). The Irish ELDERMET study (Elderly to benefit from Research Project) demonstrated the correlation between intestinal microbiota diversity and health outcomes such as overall health, frailty, and proper immune functions, underlying the gut microbiota composition as a possible indicator of healthy ageing. Multiple studies showed the interplay between the intestinal microbiota and modulation of central nervous system (CNS) functions and neurodegeneration processes, pointing to the microbiome-gut-brain axis as one of the factors modulating host homeostasis in health and disease. In the past decade, the alterations of the gut microbiota, which are called dysbiosis, have been connected with the pathophysiology of numerous common diseases such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, gastrointestinal diseases, and cardiovascular events. Dysbiosis state is also implicated in neurological and neurodegenerative disorders such as autism, and Alzheimer's (AD) or Parkinson's (PD) diseases.

"Recently, bacterial strains producing SCFAs have gained extreme popularity. SCFAs are small organic monocarboxylic acids, released after the fermentation of indigestible alimentary fiber (mainly galacto- or fructooligosaccharides), plant-derived polysaccharides, or the metabolism of amino acids, and are considered a key gut-derived metabolites with beneficial health effects and as essential in gut-brain crosstalk. The type of formed SCFAs is correlated with the kind of fiber ingested and the overall gut microbiota population. For example, microbes belonging to Firmicutes phyla (e.g., Lachnospiraceae, Eubacterium, or Roseburia belonging to the Clostridia class) are responsible for the main production of butyrate, whereas Bifidobacteria spp. produce lactate and acetate. SCFAs are significantly reduced during dysbiosis, where disrupted gut epithelial integrity, inflammation, and altered microbiome metabolic processes occur. In a healthy colon, levels of SCFAs can vary depending on a diet; however, in multiple diseases, these levels are altered. SCFAs may also act in an indirect or direct way through G-protein-coupled receptors or as histone deacetylase epigenetic modulators. They participate in various physiological processes, such as cell energetics and colonocyte metabolism and skeletal, adipose, and liver tissue modulation.

Additionally, it was shown that amyloids generated by microbes can influence IL-17A and IL-22 proinflammatory cytokines production, considered as a key players in NFkappaB signaling, both associated with AD and capable of crossing the BBB and GI tract.",16171393.0,zAwtkXq5N1,712,small intestine epithelial cells,886.0,918.0,Cellline,877.0,882.0,Abeta,Species,Location_of
"The PD microbiome has a diminished variety of bacterial taxonomic groups, especially the ones associated with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects and the increase of phyla, which has toxic effects. Predominantly, the reduction was observed in the Lachnospiraceae family, including Butyrivibrio, Pseudobutyrivibrio, Coprococcus, Blautia and SCFAs-producing Prevotellaceae. The increased amount of Enterobacteriaceae is linked to the severity of postural instability and walking difficulties. Moreover, the PD microbiome is characterised by increased Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium species and decreased amount of Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae. The overgrowth of Akkermansia spp. in PD patients may be strain-specific and can be related to immune-response alterations, decreased mucus thicknesses, and increased constipation. Faecalibacterium family is a crucial player producing SCFAs and anti-inflammatory metabolites, maintaining gut health. Faecalibacterium balance disturbances can lead to impaired gut-barrier function, increasing the risk of infection with enteric pathogens and boosting alpha-synuclein formation. Similarly, the Lachnospiraceae family can produce butyrate, important for the proper function of the gut epithelium. Decreased Lachnospiraceae quantity might aggravate gut inflammation, stimulate toxin production, and damage the integrity of the gut epithelial barrier. PD patients' intestinal microflora were characterised by a diminished abundance of Lachnospiraceae, which was positively correlated with PD progress, cognitive decline, and impaired motor functions. These microbiome's compositional changes correlate well with some metabolic switches. PD microbiota show reduced SCFAs production, decreased carbohydrate fermentation, and augmented proteolytic fermentation. Chen et al. demonstrated that the SCFA level was relevant to microbiota composition changes and the clinical severity of PD. The levels of SCFAs acetate, butyrate, and propionate in fecal samples of PD patients were significantly reduced, contrary to their elevated concentration in plasma. Rodent models of PD disease have shown a positive effect of SCFAs on behavior and PD symptoms. Butyrate, as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, exerts neuroprotective activity, reducing dopaminergic cell death, and motor impairment, and improving cognitive functions. Taken together, SCFAs play an important role in protection from PD disease and could be proposed as representative gut-oriented indicators for diversifying individuals with PD and placing disease progression.",16553034.0,2O7YiIY6Ei,rL4iRQ7UyD,Enterobacteriaceae,406.0,424.0,Species,454.0,499.0,postural instability and walking difficulties,Disease,Associated_with
"Multiple sclerosis is a chronic neurodegenerative autoimmune disorder, where the human immune system attacks the myelin sheath surrounding axon terminals, thereby triggering long-lasting inflammation within the CNS, abrasion formation, and demyelination of axons. Besides, afterward, it can cause autonomic and cognitive problems, motor, sensory, and visual flaws, and finally paralysis and disruption of the BBB. Various animal and human studies suggested the participation of gut microbiota in the development of MS. Animal studies on an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mice model revealed a significant reduction in Lactobacillus phyla, contributing to an impairment of the mice's immune systems. In patients diagnosed with MS, a reduction in the variety and quantity of gut bacteria was detected, confirming a moderate dysbiosis state.

"At present, it is generally believed that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota is an important factor affecting the integrity of the intestinal barrier. Previous studies showed that the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota could lead to the rapid proliferation of intestinal pathogenic bacteria, and the pro-inflammatory factors released by them seriously damaged the structure and function of the intestinal barrier, and it also promoted the occurrence and development of diseases in the digestive system as well as metabolic system. Furthermore, the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota triggers intestinal mucosal barrier damage, leading to inflammation and disordered nutrient metabolism. Overactivated inflammation caused by microbiota dysbiosis disrupts normal intestinal mucosal barrier function, and increases intestinal permeability to promote bacterial translocation, leading to endotoxemia and inflammation, thereby increasing the risk of CVDs.",16622110.0,240,mPr80VVBfO,dysbiosis,181.0,190.0,Disease,294.0,318.0,pro-inflammatory factors,Chemical,increase
"The main end product of bacterial fermentation, and therefore the most predominant, is the SCFA propionic acid (PA), which positively influences CNS regeneration processes such as remyelination (due to the former increase of the amount of intestinal T regulatory cells and protecting against the white matter and axonal loss). Hoyles et al. demonstrated the contribution of propionate to the BBB integrity and the modulation of gut-brain axis. BBB homeostasis and integrity are necessary for proper CNS development and function. Recently, a positive correlation between microbial-induced BBB dysfunction (barrier integrity disturbances followed by leakage) and disorders such as AD has been established. Another member of the SCFAs family, which has a documented influence on homeostasis and AD progression, is butyrate, an important driver of metabolic processes with the ability to influence intestinal macrophages, increasing immunomodulation and decreasing the histone deacetylase inhibition-mediated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Butyrate, as an SCFA, influences the immune response crossing the BBB and drives the maturation and metabolism of microglia cells. It regulates the secretion of gut hormones, such as glucagon-like peptide-1, which can improve hippocampus neuroplasticity.

"SCFAs may prevent obesity by regulating the homeostasis of glucose and lipid metabolism. For instance, acetate decreases appetite and nutrient intake. Propionate activates intestinal gluconeogenesis by a gut-brain neural circuit to promote energy balance. Butyrate provides energy for colon cells, maintains the integrity of intestinal walls, and improves the insulin response, which activates gluconeogenesis to maintain the balance of glucose and energy through the cAMP pathway. And one study indicated that oral butyrate intake prevents obesity and insulin resistance. Furthermore, the role of SCFAs in metabolic hemostasis is related to other factors. Adenosine monophosphate activating protein (AMPK) is a heterotrimeric enzyme that stimulates liver and muscle fatty acid oxidation pathways. SCFAs promote the activity of AMPK and improve its ability to oxidize fatty acids. Last, SCFAs can affect the development of dyslipidemia. SCFAs increase the expression of fasting-induced adipose factor (FIAF), a circulating lipoprotein lipase inhibitor, by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-gamma), thereby decreasing the activity of lipoproteinases and inhibiting lipolysis in adipose tissues.

"In the past decade, single dietary factors which can positively manipulate the gut microbiota-brain axis through microbiome modulation have gained significant attention. One of these factors is probiotic bacteria and/or prebiotics. Probiotics are defined as microbial organisms with a beneficial role in the host's health and homeostasis, which help to preserve digestive, metabolic, immune, and neuroendocrine functions. Naturally probiotic bacteria can be found in fermented food. Experimental results revealed that the administration of probiotics alone or in combination with prebiotics (fructooligosaccharides or galactooligosaccharides) improved the gastrointestinal barrier, which is the first line of ""defence"" from harmful factors occurring in food, and the microbiome. Probiotics and prebiotics are well-documented ""problem-solution"" for gastrointestinal diseases. Moreover, probiotics can reduce CNS inflammatory processes and activation of microglia, demonstrating promising potential for use in neurodegenerative diseases as ingestible ""psychobiotics"". Many studies indicate that the ingestion of probiotics can serve as a microbiological strategy against neurodegenerative diseases such as AD; however, the exact mechanism is under investigation. Experiments performed on mice underline the hypothesis that mechanisms related to neuroprotective effects of Bifidobacterium breve administration may be connected with neuroinflammation and cognition pathways, probably through the production of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) neurotransmitter and the regulation of the gut microbial composition. Clinical results of a randomized double-blind controlled trial revealed that 3-month exposure to Lactobacillus spp. And a Bifidobacterium bifidum ""cocktail"" enhanced cognitive functions and memory, as examined in a mini-mental state test. It was demonstrated that Bifidobacterium breve exerts positive and unique activity in AD patients, improving cognitive functions and reducing neuroinflammation.

"Aromatic amino acids including tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine are metabolized into indole and phenols by certain intestinal anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, and Peptostreptococcus. Tryptophan is decomposed into indole, indoleacetic acid, indole-3-lactic acid, 3-methylindole (skatole) and other indole compounds under the action of tryptophanase. Tryptophanase is the key enzyme that generates indole. The activity of the enzyme is easily induced by the substrate tryptophan, so when the amount of tryptophan changes in the colonic environment, the content of indole will fluctuate greatly. Of note, the metabolic products of aromatic amino acids generated by gut microbiota have a great impact on the pathology of cardiometabolic diseases. For example, indole propionic acid is associated with insulin sensitivity and appears to reduce the risk of diabetes. Moreover, the gut microbiota metabolizes dietary tryptophan to indoxyl, which further generates indoxyl sulfate through sulfonation. Excessive accumulation of indoxyl sulfate causes cardiomyocyte damage and increases thrombus formation. Another phenol compound, 4-methylphenol, can inhibit the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into mature adipocytes, induce apoptosis and reduce glucose uptake. In addition, benzoic acid is an aromatic carboxylic acid synthesized by colonic microorganisms by metabolizing dietary aromatic compounds.

"BAs, as by-products of cholesterol metabolism, are the main organic component of bile and are synthesized in hepatocytes. Cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) are primary BAs directly synthesized from cholesterol; secondary BAs include deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholic acid (LCA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and their glycine and taurine conjugated forms. BAs are excreted into the intestine to aid in the digestion and absorption of lipids and combine with farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and takeda-G-protein receptor 5 (TGR5) (Fig. 2). There is a strong biochemical relationship between BAs and gut microbiota. Some gut microbiota in healthy people can convert conjugated BAs into free BAs, and can transform BAs into secondary BAs with the help of bile salt hydrolase (BSH) and cholesterol 7-alpha hydroxy-lase (CYP7A1), so as to reduce blood cholesterol by affecting the enterohepatic circulation of BAs. Besides, the gut microbiota affects the metabolism of BAs by regulating the activity of BSH to reduce LDL cholesterol levels. BAs have bacteriostatic properties and an antimicrobial effect. BAs destroy the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane and thereby change the intestinal microecology. BAs also prevent bacteria from overgrowth and decrease inflammation. More importantly, BAs are also closely associated with CVDs. For example, BAs levels in the feces of patients with CVDs are different from those in healthy individuals.

"Experimental research confirms the hypothesis regarding SCFA reduction in autoimmune diseases (MS among others) and altered gut microbiota. A low level of SCFAs dysregulates Treg cell functions, leading to insufficient immune tolerance towards endogenous components and enteric microbiota. However, this process can be reversed by SCFAs supplementation (e.g., propionic acid). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing NFkappaB activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation and on microglial cells in vitro. TUDCA binds to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) expressed in microglial cells. This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS). Experimental results demonstrated that TUDCA acted as a double-edged sword, triggering microglia enhancement in anti-inflammatory and alternatively activated markers and on the other hand reducing the infiltration of macrophages and microglia with expressed pro-inflammatory markers. Interestingly, during neuroinflammation, microglial cells change their morphology, converting themselves into reactive macrophage-like forms. However, microglial cells are flexible, as they can sometimes polarize towards alternatively activated phenotypes, promoting CNS pathologies (proinflammatory or M1 microglia), or exert anti-inflammatory effects, boosting cell repair and remodeling. Bile acids were identified as nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor agonists, leading to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) depletion (in a mouse model) and neuroinflammatory process adjustment. The administration of the complex probiotic positively influenced the intestinal flora balance in patients diagnosed with MS.

"Previous results have indicated that the metabolic regulation of BAs may be associated with T2D but the specific changes in BAs and the related mechanisms remain to be studied.

A study also suggested that patients with T2D had no change in plasma total BAs, but had an increase in DCA and a decrease in CDCA in plasma. Another study found that the plasma total BA concentration in patients with T2D was not significantly different from that of healthy people; however, the concentration of DCA in the plasma of patients with T2D was significantly higher than that of healthy controls. The mechanism may be that FXR and TGR5 are inhibited during insulin resistance, and the most effective natural ligands of the receptors, DCA and CA, are compensatorily increased. Besides, circulating BAs levels including DCA, TCA, TDCA, and glycodeoxycholic acid, are positively associated with the risk of T2D, while taurohyodeoxycholic acid is negatively associated with diabetes.

Additionally, BCAAs are the key regulatory factor of mTORC1. It activates mTORC1 and ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (S6K1) by inducing the phosphorylation of IRS1, blocking the insulin signaling pathway, and eventually causing insulin resistance. However, 2 other studies have shown that BCAAs may exert their functions without mTORC1. One study reported that the metabolites of BCAAs, 3-hydroxy isobutyrate, could cause insulin resistance by promoting skeletal muscle sprouting. Another study reported that a diet rich in BCAAs can cause overeating, obesity, and shortened lifespan, which was not related to the mTOR signaling pathway in the liver but is mainly due to hyperphagia.",18449544.0,2355,FyT4I6Ve1e,hyperphagia,1129.0,1140.0,Disease,1023.0,1041.0,shortened lifespan,Disease,causes

Bacteroidetes are detected in children genetically predisposed to type 1 diabetes (T1D). Regarding T2D, patients were characterized by a decrease in several butyrate-producing bacteria and an increase in many opportunistic pathogens. For example, patients with T2D have reduced Clostridium butyricum in the gut, a main butyrate-producing bacteria. Lower concentrations of butyrate producing microbiota have been observed in fecal samples of patients with T2D. Moreover, Lactobacillus is positively correlated with fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels, while Clostridium is negatively correlated with fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels. Patients with T2D have significantly higher levels of Lactobacillus in fecal samples than healthy individuals.

"Recent evidence has demonstrated the importance of the gut microbiota in the formation and development of the immune system. The gut microbiota has profound effects on the formation of lymphoid tissue and the development of the immune system. It stimulates the development of intestinal-associated lymphoid tissues, activates lymphocytes, and regulates the production of immunoglobulin A to defend against pathogens. The structural components of gut microbiota such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), flagella, and peptidoglycan, can interact with receptors on human cells to stimulate and guide the host immune response. For instance, LPS binds to Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, flagella binds to TLR5, and peptidoglycan binds to TLR2, triggering the expression of a large number of downstream inflammatory factors, thereby affecting the cardiovascular system. Specially, LPS can interact with different receptors to induce inflammation and immune responses to increase intestinal permeability and CVDs susceptibility (Fig. 1).",16622924.0,279,38PGapur_I,lipopolysaccharide,469.0,487.0,Chemical,446.0,460.0,gut microbiota,Species,part_of

"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal health condition caused by the progressive neural death of the spinal cord, brain stem, and motor cortex neurons, causing advanced weakness, paralysis, eating difficulties, and respiratory failure. One of the main signs of ALS is the accumulation of phosphorylated protein, which binds to DNA in the form of protein aggregates deposited in glia and motor neurons.

"The origins of Parkinson's disease are the result of many factors such as increased age, polygenic factors (disease-segregating mutations in alpha-synuclein protein occurring in 15% of PD patients), toxins, and infectious agents. In 2006, Braak et al. assumed the gut-related origins of Parkinson's disease. One of the key pathological hallmarks of PD is Lewy bodies, being eosinophilic inclusion forms of misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates. Importantly, alpha-synuclein protein has a tendency to misfold and form aggregates. Its accumulation has been detected during bacterial and viral infections in the gut. Moreover, it can be recognized as a characteristic indicator of PD neural degeneration. This protein aggregate can boost the local immune response. Interestingly, alpha-synuclein deposition has been confirmed in the neurons of the intestinal submucosa, together with a possibility of the alpha-synuclein transport to the brain via the vagus nerve (translocation of prion-like proteins). Misfolded alpha-synuclein triggers neuronal dysfunction and progressive degeneration, thereby enabling disease progression. Additionally, alpha-synuclein deposition in CNS is associated with intestinal hyperpermeability, TLRs, and pro-inflammatory cytokine overexpression.

"The gut microbiome is crucially engaged in the regulation and maintenance of human health and homeostasis, i.e., proper intestine motion, fibre digestion, regulating the development of host immunity, and exerting a protective effect against pathogenic factors (such as Campylobacter jejuni, Helicobacter pylori, and Clostridium difficile). The Irish ELDERMET study (Elderly to benefit from Research Project) demonstrated the correlation between intestinal microbiota diversity and health outcomes such as overall health, frailty, and proper immune functions, underlying the gut microbiota composition as a possible indicator of healthy ageing. Multiple studies showed the interplay between the intestinal microbiota and modulation of central nervous system (CNS) functions and neurodegeneration processes, pointing to the microbiome-gut-brain axis as one of the factors modulating host homeostasis in health and disease. In the past decade, the alterations of the gut microbiota, which are called dysbiosis, have been connected with the pathophysiology of numerous common diseases such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, gastrointestinal diseases, and cardiovascular events. Dysbiosis state is also implicated in neurological and neurodegenerative disorders such as autism, and Alzheimer's (AD) or Parkinson's (PD) diseases.

"It remains unclear how the gut microbiota and BAs profiles interact with each other and whether the interaction is associated with obesity. Mice fed BAs exhibited obesity and a composition change in the obesity-associated gut microbiota, which is similar to high-fat diet-fed mice. Under a high-fat diet, the concentration of intestinal BAs increases, and the composition of gut microbiota alternates. For example, the increased BAs are the main reason for the marked increase in the abundance of the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. Another study has shown that BAs and a high-fat diet promote the growth of Bilophila wadsworthia in mice, and secondary BAs produced by Bilophila spp. have been shown to induce obesity. What's more, it has been reported that the low capacity of microbiota to metabolize Tauro-beta-muricholic acid, a primary BA, might increase the risk of obesity and insulin resistance.

"BAs, as by-products of cholesterol metabolism, are the main organic component of bile and are synthesized in hepatocytes. Cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) are primary BAs directly synthesized from cholesterol; secondary BAs include deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholic acid (LCA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and their glycine and taurine conjugated forms. BAs are excreted into the intestine to aid in the digestion and absorption of lipids and combine with farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and takeda-G-protein receptor 5 (TGR5) (Fig. 2). There is a strong biochemical relationship between BAs and gut microbiota. Some gut microbiota in healthy people can convert conjugated BAs into free BAs, and can transform BAs into secondary BAs with the help of bile salt hydrolase (BSH) and cholesterol 7-alpha hydroxy-lase (CYP7A1), so as to reduce blood cholesterol by affecting the enterohepatic circulation of BAs. Besides, the gut microbiota affects the metabolism of BAs by regulating the activity of BSH to reduce LDL cholesterol levels. BAs have bacteriostatic properties and an antimicrobial effect. BAs destroy the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane and thereby change the intestinal microecology. BAs also prevent bacteria from overgrowth and decrease inflammation. More importantly, BAs are also closely associated with CVDs. For example, BAs levels in the feces of patients with CVDs are different from those in healthy individuals.

"At the end of this chapter, it is worth mentioning the fact that the interaction between the microbiome and the host is bidirectional, and some metabolic changes, which could be a pathological result of disease progression, also influence microbiome metabolism. A good example is a disturbance in cholesterol homeostasis, which correlates with an augmented probability of Alzheimer's disease occurrence. In addition, alteration of the intestinal microbiota composition with the subsequent fluctuations in the serum and brain levels of bile acids (BAs) is involved in the development of AD. BAs can act as detergents, affecting BBB permeability, and incrementing brain influx of peripheral cholesterol and BAs. Therefore, proper cholesterol elimination pathways play a crucial role in AD prevention and treatment. The gut microbiome is a main ""organ"" metabolizing secondary bile acids. Peripheral cholesterol is eliminated mainly through its liver conversion to BAs. The gut microbiota performs BA transformation via deconjugation and dehydroxylation, leading to secondary BA formation. Nho et al. investigated the correlation between neurodegeneration and BAs, B-amyloid, and tau protein concentration. The application of targeted metabolomics enabled the determination of the association between intestinal microbiota-derived secondary bile acids and sera BAs. Interestingly, the analysis indicated an imbalanced BA ratio, underlying an increased amount of secondary BAs over primary ones. Another clinical study confirmed the correlation between bile acid metabolic profile and the prevalence of AD and mild cognitive impairment, showing similar BA ratio disruptions. Decreased cognitive functions were positively associated with increased concentrations of secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid, and glycolithocholic acid. The described results suggested the involvement of the pathological gut microbiota in AD development; however, still it requires more in-depth studies.",16559364.0,774,792,BA,994.0,996.0,Chemical,1966.0,1968.0,AD,Disease,None
"The health of the gut microbiome can vary depending on various factors including diet (e.g., ingestion of saturated/unsaturated dietary fats, vitamins, minerals, dairy products, alcoholic beverages, polyphenols containing food such as cocoa-rich chocolate, tea, or coffee), dietary patterns, geographical area, and diet-related habits (sometimes varying between males and females) and sex (the influence of sex hormones). A positive correlation between polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (N-3 PUFA), and alpha-linolenic acid (aLNA) ingestion and protection against PD development in dose-response trends was demonstrated. American studies demonstrated that PUFA replacement with increased animal fat intake (Western Diet) significantly increased the risk of PD in males only. Excessive animal fat intake can promote dysbiosis and the production of harmful microbial metabolites, which can increase the prevalence of the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, sex differences are implicated in the mental health and prevalence of psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, and neurodegenerative disorders. It has been demonstrated that PD patients usually have altered microbiome compositions compared with controls. Similar to AD, many sex differences in PD are correlated with the protective nature of estrogens, as they are impacted by the gut-brain axis and protect against oxidative damage, thereby supporting dopaminergic function. It has been demonstrated that at age 45, the estimated overall lifetime risk for AD is about 20% for females and 10% for males, which is followed by a disruption in the patient's gut microbiota composition. In summary, it is worth underlining the correlation between the gut microbiome, immune system and brain, mental health, and behavior.",16221004.0,yU0ZKwnpmk,1850,tea,257.0,260.0,Chemical,18.0,32.0,gut microbiome,Species,affects

Meanwhile, butyrate increases the acetylation of H3 histone in the Forkhead box protein P3 (FOXP3) promoter by inhibiting HDAC4, thus promoting Treg differentiation, affecting G1-phase-specific cyclins, and further resulting in the markedly inhibited proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, thereby inhibiting myocardial fibrosis and improving heart function.",17066164.0,Vq4BEbC5E6,Yz8UVWYroh,SCFAs,212.0,217.0,Chemical,246.0,250.0,HDAC,Species,decrease

"Trillions of microorganisms colonize the anaerobic and nutritious environment in the gut to form a healthy intestinal physiological ecosystem. These communities are regarded as ""gut microbiota"", and the sum total of all microorganism genomes in the gut, including their DNA sequences and other genetic information, are together called ""gut microbiomes"". Most intestinal microbial communities in the human intestinal tract are bacteria with complex structures. There are more than 1,000 species of intestinal bacteria, and the number reaches approximately 1014. The ratio of bacterial number to human cell number ranged from 10:1 to 1:1. It also contains 100-fold more genes than our own genome, which is called the second genome of the human body.

"Experimental research confirms the hypothesis regarding SCFA reduction in autoimmune diseases (MS among others) and altered gut microbiota. A low level of SCFAs dysregulates Treg cell functions, leading to insufficient immune tolerance towards endogenous components and enteric microbiota. However, this process can be reversed by SCFAs supplementation (e.g., propionic acid). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing NFkappaB activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation and on microglial cells in vitro. TUDCA binds to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) expressed in microglial cells. This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS). Experimental results demonstrated that TUDCA acted as a double-edged sword, triggering microglia enhancement in anti-inflammatory and alternatively activated markers and on the other hand reducing the infiltration of macrophages and microglia with expressed pro-inflammatory markers. Interestingly, during neuroinflammation, microglial cells change their morphology, converting themselves into reactive macrophage-like forms. However, microglial cells are flexible, as they can sometimes polarize towards alternatively activated phenotypes, promoting CNS pathologies (proinflammatory or M1 microglia), or exert anti-inflammatory effects, boosting cell repair and remodeling. Bile acids were identified as nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor agonists, leading to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) depletion (in a mouse model) and neuroinflammatory process adjustment. The administration of the complex probiotic positively influenced the intestinal flora balance in patients diagnosed with MS. The probiotic prevented the onset of dysbiosis, significantly increasing the amount of Methanobrevibacter and Akkermansia, Prevotella, and Sutterella in MS patients, influencing gene expression and the production of beneficial bacterial metabolites.",16224291.0,1281,Z1-i-qD4w2,TUDCA,766.0,771.0,Chemical,966.0,982.0,microglial cells,Cellline,improve
"Insufficient dietary fiber intake is considered to be an important risk factor for diabetes. The decrease in the production of SCFAs counts for an important reason here. Modulation of dietary SCFAs is thought to reshape the gut microbiota in diabetes and ameliorate diabetes. SCFAs increase fatty acid oxidation and energy expenditure to decrease the risk of suffering from T2D. Of note, T2D patients have lower levels of butyrate-generating bacteria. Butyrate could promote the secretion of postprandial insulin; and the increase in fecal propionic acid was associated with an increase in T2D risk. In oral glucose tolerance test, a high butyrate-producing microbiota was associated with an improved insulin response (indicating improved beta-cell function), and butyrate concentration was directly related to postprandial insulin sensitivity. Besides, in signal transduction regulation, butyrate could also inhibit HDAC expression in juvenile diabetic rats to modulate the p38/ERK/MAPK signaling pathway, which ultimately prevents beta-cell apoptosis and improves glucose homeostasis.",18120409.0,oIvNXqjjSP,XiQrzpCi11,gut microbiota,224.0,238.0,Species,811.0,831.0,postprandial insulin,Species,None

Preclinical tests on genetically modified mice with PD demonstrated the correlation between Akkermansia muciniphila and Bilophila wadsworthia abundance and decreased the mice motor activity. Furthermore, Akkermansia muciniphila produces high amounts of pro-inflammatory hydrogen sulphide, correlated with PD pathology and being a neurotoxin affecting brain mitochondrial energy homeostasis through the inhibition of brain glutathione concentration.

"Aromatic amino acids including tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine are metabolized into indole and phenols by certain intestinal anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, and Peptostreptococcus. Tryptophan is decomposed into indole, indoleacetic acid, indole-3-lactic acid, 3-methylindole (skatole) and other indole compounds under the action of tryptophanase. Tryptophanase is the key enzyme that generates indole. The activity of the enzyme is easily induced by the substrate tryptophan, so when the amount of tryptophan changes in the colonic environment, the content of indole will fluctuate greatly. Of note, the metabolic products of aromatic amino acids generated by gut microbiota have a great impact on the pathology of cardiometabolic diseases. For example, indole propionic acid is associated with insulin sensitivity and appears to reduce the risk of diabetes. Moreover, the gut microbiota metabolizes dietary tryptophan to indoxyl, which further generates indoxyl sulfate through sulfonation. Excessive accumulation of indoxyl sulfate causes cardiomyocyte damage and increases thrombus formation. Another phenol compound, 4-methylphenol, can inhibit the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into mature adipocytes, induce apoptosis and reduce glucose uptake. In addition, benzoic acid is an aromatic carboxylic acid synthesized by colonic microorganisms by metabolizing dietary aromatic compounds.

"It is currently controversial whether supplementation with BCAAs would increase circulating BCAAs, thereby increasing the risk of diabetes. And reducing BCAAs intake promotes fat mass loss and insulin sensitivity in mice with obesity. A high BCAAs diet causes excessive feeding, mainly due to excessive appetite. Adding threonine to balance the composition of amino acids in the diet can inhibit food intake. Nevertheless, some studies have found that supplementary BCAAs, such as isoleucine and leucine, can improve insulin resistance and reduce weight to lower the risk of obesity and diabetes. The inconsistency may be due to the individual state of energy excess or energy deficiency. In terms of an excessive energy state, such as in patients with obesity or diabetes who have an impaired ability to degrade BCAAs, BCAAs and related metabolites accumulate in circulation to reduce insulin sensitivity and cause insulin resistance. In most elderly people with inadequate energy or athletes who maintain good fitness habits, BCAAs can improve the form of metabolism. In these people, BCAAs decomposition metabolism is increased by regulatory factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha coactivator (PGC-1alpha) and PPARalpha, so that BCAAs levels are maintained in a steady state, which ultimately promotes glucose intake and insulin sensitivity. This was supported by the study of Newgard, who pointed out that dietary intake of BCAAs might interact with a high-fat diet to induce abnormal metabolic phenotypes such as insulin resistance. Mice fed BCAAs alone did not develop insulin resistance. However, when mice were fed a high-fat diet supplemented with BCAAs, they developed insulin resistance. This study suggested that BCAAs only lead to insulin resistance in the presence of excess energy intake. Therefore, more studies are needed to explore the supplementation with BCAAs and insulin resistance as well as the development of cardiovascular risk factors.",19341206.0,2470,2454,diabetes,764.0,772.0,Disease,820.0,825.0,BCAAs,Chemical,decrease

"In summary, the gut microbiota generates a series of bioactive metabolites to interact with host metabolism. These metabolites mainly include SCFAs, primary and secondary BAs, TMAO, and so on. Among these metabolites, some exert synergistic effects to promote host health by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system to control glucose metabolism. For example, SCFAs interact with human hormones such as GLP-1 and PYY to effect energy uptake and the development of obesity. SCFAs are beneficial for regulating appetite and energy intake, and preventing the formation of atherosclerosis. Other metabolites, such as TMAO and phenylacetylglutamine (PAGln), may be toxic. For example, TMAO may be proatherogenic to promote the process of thrombosis and atherosclerosis, thereby increasing the risk of cardiovascular events. Patients with CVDs had lower levels of SCFA generation and higher levels of TMAO production due to the change in gut microbiota. Furthermore, TMAO causes vascular endothelial damage and promotes the production of atherosclerotic plaques. TMAO can also increase the release of intracellular calcium ions, enhance the reactivity of platelets, and increase the risk of thrombosis to increase CVDs susceptibility. Besides, PAGln enhances platelet reactivity and thrombosis, leading to CVDs.

"Previous results have indicated that the metabolic regulation of BAs may be associated with T2D but the specific changes in BAs and the related mechanisms remain to be studied.

Another study found that the plasma total BA concentration in patients with T2D was not significantly different from that of healthy people; however, the concentration of DCA in the plasma of patients with T2D was significantly higher than that of healthy controls. The mechanism may be that FXR and TGR5 are inhibited during insulin resistance, and the most effective natural ligands of the receptors, DCA and CA, are compensatorily increased. Besides, circulating BAs levels including DCA, TCA, TDCA, and glycodeoxycholic acid, are positively associated with the risk of T2D, while taurohyodeoxycholic acid is negatively associated with diabetes. This may be due to the fact that hydrophobic BAs isoforms (such as DCA) have been shown to be involved in inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress with glucose dysregulation, and hydrophilic BAs isoforms (such as tauroursodeoxycholic acid) have been shown to prevent inflammation and enhance insulin sensitivity.",18340523.0,bEy-orNMhi,Tzjqx9OG4E,insulin resistance,724.0,742.0,Disease,809.0,811.0,CA,Chemical,increase
"SCFAs may prevent obesity by regulating the homeostasis of glucose and lipid metabolism. For instance, acetate decreases appetite and nutrient intake. Propionate activates intestinal gluconeogenesis by a gut-brain neural circuit to promote energy balance. Butyrate provides energy for colon cells, maintains the integrity of intestinal walls, and improves the insulin response, which activates gluconeogenesis to maintain the balance of glucose and energy through the cAMP pathway. And one study indicated that oral butyrate intake prevents obesity and insulin resistance. Furthermore, the role of SCFAs in metabolic hemostasis is related to other factors. Adenosine monophosphate activating protein (AMPK) is a heterotrimeric enzyme that stimulates liver and muscle fatty acid oxidation pathways. SCFAs promote the activity of AMPK and improve its ability to oxidize fatty acids. Last, SCFAs can affect the development of dyslipidemia.

"Additionally, it has been reported that the intestinal microbiota plays a very crucial role in the neuroendocrine system, which is correlated to the gut-brain axis.

It is increasingly recognized that the establishment of intestinal microbiota in early life can impact the development as well as the function of nervous system, especially regulating neuroendocrine function. In neonatal germ-free mice, colonization with B. infantis, and Bifidobacterium could attenuate the high sensitivity of the HPA axis and establish functional neural circuits. The imbalanced microbiota may fail to execute metabolic functions, brain function and neuromodulators. The regulation of neurohumoral-immune not only promotes the development of neurological diseases, but also promotes the occurrence and development of CVDs via the HPA axis and renin-angiotensin system (RAS).

The gut microbiota of AD patients represented a diminished amount and incidence of bacteria producing butyrate and proinflammatory-acting bacterial taxa. Many studies revealed that the decreased levels of SCFAs can cause increased gut permeability together with altered gut pH levels, enabling the spread of opportunistic bacteria from Shigella and Escherichia species, elevated both in AD and PD.

"Additionally, studies have also demonstrated that BAs reduce obesity susceptibility by increasing the expression and activity of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and increasing energy expenditure by GLP-1. For instance, BAs increased the expression of UCP1 in brown adipocytes via TGR5 to enhance the release of GLP-1. Thus, there is an interrelated complex relationship between BAs and obesity.

"In fact, changes in the function of gut microecology and gut microbiota may cause the occurrence and exacerbation of various diseases. It was found that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota may lead to decreased cardiac function and increased cardiomyopathy as well as cardiac insufficiency, which is of great significance in predicting CVDs and also has important predictive significance for the prognosis of adverse cardiovascular events. The gut microbiota has been reported to be associated with CVDs and its corresponding risk factors, such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, and insulin resistance. These risk factors may affect the composition and the diversity of gut microbiota. In addition, gut dysbiosis is also linked to inflammation, oxidative stress, platelet activity, thrombosis and atherosclerosis, which contribute to the progression of CVDs. The possible mechanism of gut microbiota dysbiosis related to CVDs includes its role in increasing intestinal permeability and triggering inflammation via the LPS/TLR4 as well as NLRP3 pathways, thereby ultimately contributing to the development of CVDs. In short, the inflammation directly triggers by gut microbiota is one of the possible mechanisms of CVDs susceptibility, and material metabolism affected by gut microbiota was proposed to play a role as well.",17039945.0,Pl1iu_5wrO,487,gut microbiota,663.0,677.0,Species,790.0,805.0,atherosclerosis,Disease,Associated_with

"The mechanism by which BCAAs induce insulin resistance is still not fully understood. The rise of BCAA levels is found to regulate glycolipid metabolism, cause insulin resistance, and increase the risk of T2D. Other animal experiments have shown that elevated BCAAs are transferred to skeletal muscle, and are interfered with lipid metabolism, which causes the accumulation of lipid metabolites and ultimately leads to skeletal muscle insulin resistance. Additionally, BCAAs are the key regulatory factor of mTORC1. It activates mTORC1 and ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (S6K1) by inducing the phosphorylation of IRS1, blocking the insulin signaling pathway, and eventually causing insulin resistance. However, 2 other studies have shown that BCAAs may exert their functions without mTORC1. One study reported that the metabolites of BCAAs, 3-hydroxy isobutyrate, could cause insulin resistance by promoting skeletal muscle sprouting.

"The PD microbiome has a diminished variety of bacterial taxonomic groups, especially the ones associated with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects and the increase of phyla, which has toxic effects. Predominantly, the reduction was observed in the Lachnospiraceae family, including Butyrivibrio, Pseudobutyrivibrio, Coprococcus, Blautia and SCFAs-producing Prevotellaceae. The increased amount of Enterobacteriaceae is linked to the severity of postural instability and walking difficulties. Moreover, the PD microbiome is characterised by increased Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium species and decreased amount of Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae. The overgrowth of Akkermansia spp. in PD patients may be strain-specific and can be related to immune-response alterations, decreased mucus thicknesses, and increased constipation. Faecalibacterium family is a crucial player producing SCFAs and anti-inflammatory metabolites, maintaining gut health. Faecalibacterium balance disturbances can lead to impaired gut-barrier function, increasing the risk of infection with enteric pathogens and boosting alpha-synuclein formation. Similarly, the Lachnospiraceae family can produce butyrate, important for the proper function of the gut epithelium. Decreased Lachnospiraceae quantity might aggravate gut inflammation, stimulate toxin production, and damage the integrity of the gut epithelial barrier. PD patients' intestinal microflora were characterised by a diminished abundance of Lachnospiraceae, which was positively correlated with PD progress, cognitive decline, and impaired motor functions. These microbiome's compositional changes correlate well with some metabolic switches. PD microbiota show reduced SCFAs production, decreased carbohydrate fermentation, and augmented proteolytic fermentation. Chen et al. demonstrated that the SCFA level was relevant to microbiota composition changes and the clinical severity of PD. The levels of SCFAs acetate, butyrate, and propionate in fecal samples of PD patients were significantly reduced, contrary to their elevated concentration in plasma. Rodent models of PD disease have shown a positive effect of SCFAs on behavior and PD symptoms. Butyrate, as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, exerts neuroprotective activity, reducing dopaminergic cell death, and motor impairment, and improving cognitive functions. Taken together, SCFAs play an important role in protection from PD disease and could be proposed as representative gut-oriented indicators for diversifying individuals with PD and placing disease progression.",16553034.0,980,hZBOiBmnWf,Butyrate,2201.0,2209.0,Chemical,2289.0,2312.0,dopaminergic cell death,Disease,improve

"At the end of this chapter, it is worth mentioning the fact that the interaction between the microbiome and the host is bidirectional, and some metabolic changes, which could be a pathological result of disease progression, also influence microbiome metabolism. A good example is a disturbance in cholesterol homeostasis, which correlates with an augmented probability of Alzheimer's disease occurrence. In addition, alteration of the intestinal microbiota composition with the subsequent fluctuations in the serum and brain levels of bile acids (BAs) is involved in the development of AD. BAs can act as detergents, affecting BBB permeability, and incrementing brain influx of peripheral cholesterol and BAs. Therefore, proper cholesterol elimination pathways play a crucial role in AD prevention and treatment. The gut microbiome is a main ""organ"" metabolizing secondary bile acids. Peripheral cholesterol is eliminated mainly through its liver conversion to BAs. The gut microbiota performs BA transformation via deconjugation and dehydroxylation, leading to secondary BA formation. Nho et al. investigated the correlation between neurodegeneration and BAs, B-amyloid, and tau protein concentration. The application of targeted metabolomics enabled the determination of the association between intestinal microbiota-derived secondary bile acids and sera BAs. Interestingly, the analysis indicated an imbalanced BA ratio, underlying an increased amount of secondary BAs over primary ones. Another clinical study confirmed the correlation between bile acid metabolic profile and the prevalence of AD and mild cognitive impairment, showing similar BA ratio disruptions. Decreased cognitive functions were positively associated with increased concentrations of secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid, and glycolithocholic acid. The described results suggested the involvement of the pathological gut microbiota in AD development; however, still it requires more in-depth studies.",16559364.0,771,787,cholesterol,728.0,739.0,Chemical,784.0,786.0,AD,Disease,Associated_with

"It is currently controversial whether supplementation with BCAAs would increase circulating BCAAs, thereby increasing the risk of diabetes. And reducing BCAAs intake promotes fat mass loss and insulin sensitivity in mice with obesity. A high BCAAs diet causes excessive feeding, mainly due to excessive appetite. Adding threonine to balance the composition of amino acids in the diet can inhibit food intake. Nevertheless, some studies have found that supplementary BCAAs, such as isoleucine and leucine, can improve insulin resistance and reduce weight to lower the risk of obesity and diabetes. The inconsistency may be due to the individual state of energy excess or energy deficiency. In terms of an excessive energy state, such as in patients with obesity or diabetes who have an impaired ability to degrade BCAAs, BCAAs and related metabolites accumulate in circulation to reduce insulin sensitivity and cause insulin resistance. In most elderly people with inadequate energy or athletes who maintain good fitness habits, BCAAs can improve the form of metabolism. In these people, BCAAs decomposition metabolism is increased by regulatory factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha coactivator (PGC-1alpha) and PPARalpha, so that BCAAs levels are maintained in a steady state, which ultimately promotes glucose intake and insulin sensitivity. This was supported by the study of Newgard, who pointed out that dietary intake of BCAAs might interact with a high-fat diet to induce abnormal metabolic phenotypes such as insulin resistance. Mice fed BCAAs alone did not develop insulin resistance. However, when mice were fed a high-fat diet supplemented with BCAAs, they developed insulin resistance. This study suggested that BCAAs only lead to insulin resistance in the presence of excess energy intake. Therefore, more studies are needed to explore the supplementation with BCAAs and insulin resistance as well as the development of cardiovascular risk factors.",19341206.0,2472,2465,mice,216.0,220.0,Species,226.0,233.0,obesity,Disease,experiences

"In summary, the gut microbiota generates a series of bioactive metabolites to interact with host metabolism. These metabolites mainly include SCFAs, primary and secondary BAs, TMAO, and so on. Among these metabolites, some exert synergistic effects to promote host health by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system to control glucose metabolism. For example, SCFAs interact with human hormones such as GLP-1 and PYY to effect energy uptake and the development of obesity. SCFAs are beneficial for regulating appetite and energy intake, and preventing the formation of atherosclerosis. Other metabolites, such as TMAO and phenylacetylglutamine (PAGln), may be toxic. For example, TMAO may be proatherogenic to promote the process of thrombosis and atherosclerosis, thereby increasing the risk of cardiovascular events. Patients with CVDs had lower levels of SCFA generation and higher levels of TMAO production due to the change in gut microbiota. Furthermore, TMAO causes vascular endothelial damage and promotes the production of atherosclerotic plaques. TMAO can also increase the release of intracellular calcium ions, enhance the reactivity of platelets, and increase the risk of thrombosis to increase CVDs susceptibility. Besides, PAGln enhances platelet reactivity and thrombosis, leading to CVDs. Taken together, mounting evidence suggests that changes in gut microbiota metabolites are part of the crucial mechanisms by which the gut microbiota regulates the occurrence and development of CVDs.",18055127.0,1173,1164,Patients,825.0,833.0,Species,839.0,843.0,CVDs,Disease,experiences
"However host-microbiota interplay is not exclusively restricted to cell-cell interactions. Intestinal microbes are capable of producing a plethora of different types of compounds, i.e., small molecules (amino acids, neurotransmitters, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and other fatty acid derivatives, indoles, vitamins, and cofactors), polysaccharides, and proteins (i.e., bacteriocins), which have been reported as important factors in shaping the bacterial community and modulation of the immune system. It has been demonstrated that intestinal bacterial strains such as Escherichia coli or Lactobacillus spp. interact directly with the host's CNS (central nervous system), as they can release neurotransmitters such as dopamine, noradrenaline, histamine, acetylcholine, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), or serotonin. This metabolic status of the microbiome is also vulnerable to dysbiosis and compositional changes and often leads to metabolic disturbances. For example, dysbiosis can induce elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, intensifying oxidative stress and neuronal inflammatory processes. It has been estimated that 40% of the metabolites detected in humans are the products of bacterial metabolism, which plays a fundamental role in the modulation of the host's physiological processes, including immune-mediated neurodegeneration or affecting neural cell metabolism.",16115776.0,129,119,Lactobacillus,593.0,606.0,Species,773.0,777.0,GABA,Chemical,start
"Recently, bacterial strains producing SCFAs have gained extreme popularity. SCFAs are small organic monocarboxylic acids, released after the fermentation of indigestible alimentary fiber (mainly galacto- or fructooligosaccharides), plant-derived polysaccharides, or the metabolism of amino acids, and are considered a key gut-derived metabolites with beneficial health effects and as essential in gut-brain crosstalk. The type of formed SCFAs is correlated with the kind of fiber ingested and the overall gut microbiota population. For example, microbes belonging to Firmicutes phyla (e.g., Lachnospiraceae, Eubacterium, or Roseburia belonging to the Clostridia class) are responsible for the main production of butyrate, whereas Bifidobacteria spp. produce lactate and acetate. SCFAs are significantly reduced during dysbiosis, where disrupted gut epithelial integrity, inflammation, and altered microbiome metabolic processes occur. In a healthy colon, levels of SCFAs can vary depending on a diet; however, in multiple diseases, these levels are altered. SCFAs may also act in an indirect or direct way through G-protein-coupled receptors or as histone deacetylase epigenetic modulators. They participate in various physiological processes, such as cell energetics and colonocyte metabolism and skeletal, adipose, and liver tissue modulation. Their major functions comprise the activation of trophic factors, energy management, and the manufacturing of regulatory T-cells.

The structural components of gut microbiota such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), flagella, and peptidoglycan, can interact with receptors on human cells to stimulate and guide the host immune response. For instance, LPS binds to Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, flagella binds to TLR5, and peptidoglycan binds to TLR2, triggering the expression of a large number of downstream inflammatory factors, thereby affecting the cardiovascular system.

"Mechanically, current studies suggest that SCFAs may exert their functions through acting as energy substrates and maintaining metabolic integration by a variety of different downstream regulatory mechanisms, such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPRs) with GPR41/Recombinant Free Fatty Acid Receptor (FFAR3), GPR43/FFAR2, GPR109A, Olfactory Receptors 78 (Olfr78) in endocrine cells of the gut wall, as well as histone deacetylases (HDACs) (Fig. 2). GPR41 regulates host energy acquisition and promotes the catabolism of glucose and lipids. The decreased SCFAs may cause less activated GPR41 and higher levels of energy uptake. In addition, it has also been reported that the lower production of SCFAs in gut microbiota would increase the host's capability of obtaining energy from the diet. SCFAs from bacterial fermentation promote the secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY) through GPR43 and GPR41 from intestinal L cells.

"The bacteria living in the human gut are also called commensals. Some beneficial commensal microbes could repair the normal function of the intestinal barrier and exert anti-inflammatory effects, such as Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila), Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Roseburia intestinalis, et al. . These commensal microbes make up about 20% of the total gut microbiota. They are indispensable for maintaining the physiological function of adult tissues and organs by synthesizing a variety of vitamins, participating in food digestion, producing lactic acid, promoting intestinal peristalsis, inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microbiota, and activating the immune system. For example, one of the most important commensal microbes in the human gut is Bifidobacterium, a strictly anaerobic gram-positive bacterium, which assists the human body in the digestion and absorption of nutrients, resists the invasion of harmful bacteria, improves the immune function of the body, secretes molecules to regulate immune function, and participates in the metabolism of substances in the intestine. Besides, another common commensal microbe, A. muciniphila, a gram-positive bacterium, reduces insulin sensitivity and is inversely associated with the development of obesity and diabetes.

"In the past decade, single dietary factors which can positively manipulate the gut microbiota-brain axis through microbiome modulation have gained significant attention. One of these factors is probiotic bacteria and/or prebiotics. Probiotics are defined as microbial organisms with a beneficial role in the host's health and homeostasis, which help to preserve digestive, metabolic, immune, and neuroendocrine functions. Naturally probiotic bacteria can be found in fermented food. Experimental results revealed that the administration of probiotics alone or in combination with prebiotics (fructooligosaccharides or galactooligosaccharides) improved the gastrointestinal barrier, which is the first line of ""defence"" from harmful factors occurring in food, and the microbiome. Probiotics and prebiotics are well-documented ""problem-solution"" for gastrointestinal diseases. Moreover, probiotics can reduce CNS inflammatory processes and activation of microglia, demonstrating promising potential for use in neurodegenerative diseases as ingestible ""psychobiotics"". Many studies indicate that the ingestion of probiotics can serve as a microbiological strategy against neurodegenerative diseases such as AD; however, the exact mechanism is under investigation. Experiments performed on mice underline the hypothesis that mechanisms related to neuroprotective effects of Bifidobacterium breve administration may be connected with neuroinflammation and cognition pathways, probably through the production of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) neurotransmitter and the regulation of the gut microbial composition. Clinical results of a randomized double-blind controlled trial revealed that 3-month exposure to Lactobacillus spp. And a Bifidobacterium bifidum ""cocktail"" enhanced cognitive functions and memory, as examined in a mini-mental state test. It was demonstrated that Bifidobacterium breve exerts positive and unique activity in AD patients, improving cognitive functions and reducing neuroinflammation.

"Given that the gut microbiota is essential in human health, changes in the composition and function of the gut microbiota may result in the development of diseases. Due to the influence of host genes, diet, antibiotic use, lifestyle, drugs as well as other factors, the composition and diversity of gut microbiota gradually change with interindividual variation. For example, a high-fat diet leads to an increase in the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. When the composition and proportion of gut microbiota change, inflammation and metabolic abnormalities can be induced, which contribute to the development of different diseases. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota refers to changes in the number, species and composition of gut microbiota. In recent years, gut microbiota dysbiosis has been shown to be critically involved in health and has emerged as a potential pathogenesis for various diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, cancers, and CVDs. Moreover, gut dysbiosis is also a driver of metabolic inflammation and metabolic dysregulation, which serve as a key feature of metabolic diseases. For instance, the translocation of intestinal bacteria to the blood and liver through the portal venous system together with its metabolites are able to stimulate the release of inflammatory factors, and promote the occurrence of non-alcoholic fatty liver as well as hepatitis.

"Insufficient dietary fiber intake is considered to be an important risk factor for diabetes. The decrease in the production of SCFAs counts for an important reason here. Modulation of dietary SCFAs is thought to reshape the gut microbiota in diabetes and ameliorate diabetes. SCFAs increase fatty acid oxidation and energy expenditure to decrease the risk of suffering from T2D. Of note, T2D patients have lower levels of butyrate-generating bacteria. Butyrate could promote the secretion of postprandial insulin; and the increase in fecal propionic acid was associated with an increase in T2D risk. In oral glucose tolerance test, a high butyrate-producing microbiota was associated with an improved insulin response (indicating improved beta-cell function), and butyrate concentration was directly related to postprandial insulin sensitivity.

"BAs, as by-products of cholesterol metabolism, are the main organic component of bile and are synthesized in hepatocytes. Cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) are primary BAs directly synthesized from cholesterol; secondary BAs include deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholic acid (LCA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and their glycine and taurine conjugated forms. BAs are excreted into the intestine to aid in the digestion and absorption of lipids and combine with farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and takeda-G-protein receptor 5 (TGR5) (Fig. 2).

"It is currently controversial whether supplementation with BCAAs would increase circulating BCAAs, thereby increasing the risk of diabetes. And reducing BCAAs intake promotes fat mass loss and insulin sensitivity in mice with obesity. A high BCAAs diet causes excessive feeding, mainly due to excessive appetite. Adding threonine to balance the composition of amino acids in the diet can inhibit food intake. Nevertheless, some studies have found that supplementary BCAAs, such as isoleucine and leucine, can improve insulin resistance and reduce weight to lower the risk of obesity and diabetes. The inconsistency may be due to the individual state of energy excess or energy deficiency. In terms of an excessive energy state, such as in patients with obesity or diabetes who have an impaired ability to degrade BCAAs, BCAAs and related metabolites accumulate in circulation to reduce insulin sensitivity and cause insulin resistance. In most elderly people with inadequate energy or athletes who maintain good fitness habits, BCAAs can improve the form of metabolism. In these people, BCAAs decomposition metabolism is increased by regulatory factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha coactivator (PGC-1alpha) and PPARalpha, so that BCAAs levels are maintained in a steady state, which ultimately promotes glucose intake and insulin sensitivity. This was supported by the study of Newgard, who pointed out that dietary intake of BCAAs might interact with a high-fat diet to induce abnormal metabolic phenotypes such as insulin resistance. Mice fed BCAAs alone did not develop insulin resistance. However, when mice were fed a high-fat diet supplemented with BCAAs, they developed insulin resistance. This study suggested that BCAAs only lead to insulin resistance in the presence of excess energy intake.

"Experimental research confirms the hypothesis regarding SCFA reduction in autoimmune diseases (MS among others) and altered gut microbiota. A low level of SCFAs dysregulates Treg cell functions, leading to insufficient immune tolerance towards endogenous components and enteric microbiota. However, this process can be reversed by SCFAs supplementation (e.g., propionic acid). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing NFkappaB activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation and on microglial cells in vitro. TUDCA binds to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) expressed in microglial cells. This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS). Experimental results demonstrated that TUDCA acted as a double-edged sword, triggering microglia enhancement in anti-inflammatory and alternatively activated markers and on the other hand reducing the infiltration of macrophages and microglia with expressed pro-inflammatory markers. Interestingly, during neuroinflammation, microglial cells change their morphology, converting themselves into reactive macrophage-like forms. However, microglial cells are flexible, as they can sometimes polarize towards alternatively activated phenotypes, promoting CNS pathologies (proinflammatory or M1 microglia), or exert anti-inflammatory effects, boosting cell repair and remodeling. Bile acids were identified as nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor agonists, leading to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) depletion (in a mouse model) and neuroinflammatory process adjustment.

"Additionally, it has been reported that the intestinal microbiota plays a very crucial role in the neuroendocrine system, which is correlated to the gut-brain axis. As the major neuroendocrine system, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulates various pathophysiological processes in response to inside and outside stressors. It is increasingly recognized that the establishment of intestinal microbiota in early life can impact the development as well as the function of nervous system, especially regulating neuroendocrine function. In neonatal germ-free mice, colonization with B. infantis, and Bifidobacterium could attenuate the high sensitivity of the HPA axis and establish functional neural circuits. The imbalanced microbiota may fail to execute metabolic functions, brain function and neuromodulators. The regulation of neurohumoral-immune not only promotes the development of neurological diseases, but also promotes the occurrence and development of CVDs via the HPA axis and renin-angiotensin system (RAS). For example, dysregulation of the gut-brain axis was associated with hypertension. Interestingly, the gut microbiota can be called ""an endocrine organ"" that biologically regulates host metabolism, for affecting the host's endocrine system by altering the functional metabolism of important hormones such as leptin, ghrelin and cortisol. These hormones also have a great impact on human health and may cause diseases under abnormal circumstances.",18479539.0,445,447,human,1413.0,1418.0,Species,1001.0,1006.0,renin,Gene,None

"Mechanically, current studies suggest that SCFAs may exert their functions through acting as energy substrates and maintaining metabolic integration by a variety of different downstream regulatory mechanisms, such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPRs) with GPR41/Recombinant Free Fatty Acid Receptor (FFAR3), GPR43/FFAR2, GPR109A, Olfactory Receptors 78 (Olfr78) in endocrine cells of the gut wall, as well as histone deacetylases (HDACs) (Fig. 2). GPR41 regulates host energy acquisition and promotes the catabolism of glucose and lipids. The decreased SCFAs may cause less activated GPR41 and higher levels of energy uptake. In addition, it has also been reported that the lower production of SCFAs in gut microbiota would increase the host's capability of obtaining energy from the diet. SCFAs from bacterial fermentation promote the secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY) through GPR43 and GPR41 from intestinal L cells. GLP-1 increased pancreatic insulin secretion, and inhibited the production of glucagon. Deletion of GLP-1 abolished the beneficial effects of prebiotics on weight gain, glucose metabolism, and inflammatory pathway activation.

"It remains unclear how the gut microbiota and BAs profiles interact with each other and whether the interaction is associated with obesity. Mice fed BAs exhibited obesity and a composition change in the obesity-associated gut microbiota, which is similar to high-fat diet-fed mice. Under a high-fat diet, the concentration of intestinal BAs increases, and the composition of gut microbiota alternates. For example, the increased BAs are the main reason for the marked increase in the abundance of the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. Another study has shown that BAs and a high-fat diet promote the growth of Bilophila wadsworthia in mice, and secondary BAs produced by Bilophila spp. have been shown to induce obesity. What's more, it has been reported that the low capacity of microbiota to metabolize Tauro-beta-muricholic acid, a primary BA, might increase the risk of obesity and insulin resistance. Therefore, BAs profiles affect the composition of gut microbiota, and gut microbiota also regulates the production and ratio of different BAs to play an important role in obesity susceptibility.",18109315.0,1610,1623,Tauro-beta-muricholic acid,806.0,832.0,Chemical,887.0,894.0,insulin,Species,worsen

TMAO also reduces reverse cholesterol transportation, and changes BAs composition. Some studies genetically manipulated hepatic FMO3 to modulate lipid homeostasis, suggesting a major role of gut microbiota in lipid metabolism.

"Previous results have indicated that the metabolic regulation of BAs may be associated with T2D but the specific changes in BAs and the related mechanisms remain to be studied. It is also unclear how the different types of BAs change in patients with T2D. A study also suggested that patients with T2D had no change in plasma total BAs, but had an increase in DCA and a decrease in CDCA in plasma. Another study found that the plasma total BA concentration in patients with T2D was not significantly different from that of healthy people; however, the concentration of DCA in the plasma of patients with T2D was significantly higher than that of healthy controls. The mechanism may be that FXR and TGR5 are inhibited during insulin resistance, and the most effective natural ligands of the receptors, DCA and CA, are compensatorily increased. Besides, circulating BAs levels including DCA, TCA, TDCA, and glycodeoxycholic acid, are positively associated with the risk of T2D, while taurohyodeoxycholic acid is negatively associated with diabetes. This may be due to the fact that hydrophobic BAs isoforms (such as DCA) have been shown to be involved in inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress with glucose dysregulation, and hydrophilic BAs isoforms (such as tauroursodeoxycholic acid) have been shown to prevent inflammation and enhance insulin sensitivity.",18340523.0,2043,VXZdChM-WV,patients,590.0,598.0,Species,604.0,607.0,T2D,Disease,experiences

"Trillions of microorganisms colonize the anaerobic and nutritious environment in the gut to form a healthy intestinal physiological ecosystem. These communities are regarded as ""gut microbiota"", and the sum total of all microorganism genomes in the gut, including their DNA sequences and other genetic information, are together called ""gut microbiomes"". Most intestinal microbial communities in the human intestinal tract are bacteria with complex structures. There are more than 1,000 species of intestinal bacteria, and the number reaches approximately 1014. The ratio of bacterial number to human cell number ranged from 10:1 to 1:1. It also contains 100-fold more genes than our own genome, which is called the second genome of the human body. In terms of the types of intestinal bacteria, the gut microbiota is mainly composed of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, and this composition is relatively stable in healthy individuals but not in patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) or other diseases. Among those gut microbiota, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in the large intestine account for about 90% of the total number of gut microbiota, and the ratio is a vital health indicator reflecting the condition of health and is also associated with the incidence of CVDs. In addition, the gut microbiota maintains a symbiotic or antagonistic relationship with its host to form a dynamic and balanced microbial system.",16511252.0,45,9-DBnEVceN,cardiovascular diseases,987.0,1010.0,Disease,13.0,27.0,microorganisms,Species,None
"The bacteria living in the human gut are also called commensals. Some beneficial commensal microbes could repair the normal function of the intestinal barrier and exert anti-inflammatory effects, such as Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila), Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Roseburia intestinalis, et al. . These commensal microbes make up about 20% of the total gut microbiota. They are indispensable for maintaining the physiological function of adult tissues and organs by synthesizing a variety of vitamins, participating in food digestion, producing lactic acid, promoting intestinal peristalsis, inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microbiota, and activating the immune system. For example, one of the most important commensal microbes in the human gut is Bifidobacterium, a strictly anaerobic gram-positive bacterium, which assists the human body in the digestion and absorption of nutrients, resists the invasion of harmful bacteria, improves the immune function of the body, secretes molecules to regulate immune function, and participates in the metabolism of substances in the intestine. Besides, another common commensal microbe, A. muciniphila, a gram-positive bacterium, reduces insulin sensitivity and is inversely associated with the development of obesity and diabetes.

"Insufficient dietary fiber intake is considered to be an important risk factor for diabetes. The decrease in the production of SCFAs counts for an important reason here.

Butyrate could promote the secretion of postprandial insulin; and the increase in fecal propionic acid was associated with an increase in T2D risk. In oral glucose tolerance test, a high butyrate-producing microbiota was associated with an improved insulin response (indicating improved beta-cell function), and butyrate concentration was directly related to postprandial insulin sensitivity.

"The main end product of bacterial fermentation, and therefore the most predominant, is the SCFA propionic acid (PA), which positively influences CNS regeneration processes such as remyelination (due to the former increase of the amount of intestinal T regulatory cells and protecting against the white matter and axonal loss). Hoyles et al. demonstrated the contribution of propionate to the BBB integrity and the modulation of gut-brain axis. BBB homeostasis and integrity are necessary for proper CNS development and function. Recently, a positive correlation between microbial-induced BBB dysfunction (barrier integrity disturbances followed by leakage) and disorders such as AD has been established. Another member of the SCFAs family, which has a documented influence on homeostasis and AD progression, is butyrate, an important driver of metabolic processes with the ability to influence intestinal macrophages, increasing immunomodulation and decreasing the histone deacetylase inhibition-mediated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Butyrate, as an SCFA, influences the immune response crossing the BBB and drives the maturation and metabolism of microglia cells. It regulates the secretion of gut hormones, such as glucagon-like peptide-1, which can improve hippocampus neuroplasticity.

"At the end of this chapter, it is worth mentioning the fact that the interaction between the microbiome and the host is bidirectional, and some metabolic changes, which could be a pathological result of disease progression, also influence microbiome metabolism. A good example is a disturbance in cholesterol homeostasis, which correlates with an augmented probability of Alzheimer's disease occurrence. In addition, alteration of the intestinal microbiota composition with the subsequent fluctuations in the serum and brain levels of bile acids (BAs) is involved in the development of AD. BAs can act as detergents, affecting BBB permeability, and incrementing brain influx of peripheral cholesterol and BAs. Therefore, proper cholesterol elimination pathways play a crucial role in AD prevention and treatment. The gut microbiome is a main ""organ"" metabolizing secondary bile acids. Peripheral cholesterol is eliminated mainly through its liver conversion to BAs. The gut microbiota performs BA transformation via deconjugation and dehydroxylation, leading to secondary BA formation. Nho et al. investigated the correlation between neurodegeneration and BAs, B-amyloid, and tau protein concentration. The application of targeted metabolomics enabled the determination of the association between intestinal microbiota-derived secondary bile acids and sera BAs. Interestingly, the analysis indicated an imbalanced BA ratio, underlying an increased amount of secondary BAs over primary ones. Another clinical study confirmed the correlation between bile acid metabolic profile and the prevalence of AD and mild cognitive impairment, showing similar BA ratio disruptions. Decreased cognitive functions were positively associated with increased concentrations of secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid, and glycolithocholic acid.

"Recent studies underlined the important role of the gut microbiota in bidirectional crosstalk in Huntington's disease (HD). Huntington's disease has genetic origins related to trinucleotide expansion (CAG) in the huntingtin coding gene. Moreover, experiments performed in mice models revealed that the altered microbiota observed in the HD-suffering individuals at the pre-motor symptomatic stage highly influence health status. HD microbiota composition indicated dysbiosis, disturbances in cytokine levels, and an increase in sulphur metabolism characterized by hydrogen sulphide overproduction and negatively influencing gut health. Ultimately, the gut dysbiosis state was also described in a transgenic mice model representing Huntington's disease. Kong et al. found increased Bacteroidetes and decreased Firmicutes levels in a R6/1 transgenic mice model. In this study, dysbiosis was followed by body weight deterioration, gastrointestinal motility problems, and the loss of motor ability. Subsequent studies performed by the same group revealed the negative correlation between Blautia producta and butyrate production. Moreover, Prevotella scopos was negatively associated with ATP levels. Clinical trials performed on patients suffering from Huntington's disease revealed the prevalence of bacterial phyla belonging to Firmicutes (83%), Actinobacteria (9%), Bacteroidetes (4%), and Verrucomicrobia (1.1%) detected in the collected fecal samples.

"In summary, the gut microbiota generates a series of bioactive metabolites to interact with host metabolism. These metabolites mainly include SCFAs, primary and secondary BAs, TMAO, and so on. Among these metabolites, some exert synergistic effects to promote host health by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system to control glucose metabolism. For example, SCFAs interact with human hormones such as GLP-1 and PYY to effect energy uptake and the development of obesity. SCFAs are beneficial for regulating appetite and energy intake, and preventing the formation of atherosclerosis. Other metabolites, such as TMAO and phenylacetylglutamine (PAGln), may be toxic. For example, TMAO may be proatherogenic to promote the process of thrombosis and atherosclerosis, thereby increasing the risk of cardiovascular events. Patients with CVDs had lower levels of SCFA generation and higher levels of TMAO production due to the change in gut microbiota. Furthermore, TMAO causes vascular endothelial damage and promotes the production of atherosclerotic plaques. TMAO can also increase the release of intracellular calcium ions, enhance the reactivity of platelets, and increase the risk of thrombosis to increase CVDs susceptibility. Besides, PAGln enhances platelet reactivity and thrombosis, leading to CVDs.

"The PD microbiome has a diminished variety of bacterial taxonomic groups, especially the ones associated with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects and the increase of phyla, which has toxic effects. Predominantly, the reduction was observed in the Lachnospiraceae family, including Butyrivibrio, Pseudobutyrivibrio, Coprococcus, Blautia and SCFAs-producing Prevotellaceae. The increased amount of Enterobacteriaceae is linked to the severity of postural instability and walking difficulties. Moreover, the PD microbiome is characterised by increased Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium species and decreased amount of Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae. The overgrowth of Akkermansia spp. in PD patients may be strain-specific and can be related to immune-response alterations, decreased mucus thicknesses, and increased constipation. Faecalibacterium family is a crucial player producing SCFAs and anti-inflammatory metabolites, maintaining gut health. Faecalibacterium balance disturbances can lead to impaired gut-barrier function, increasing the risk of infection with enteric pathogens and boosting alpha-synuclein formation. Similarly, the Lachnospiraceae family can produce butyrate, important for the proper function of the gut epithelium. Decreased Lachnospiraceae quantity might aggravate gut inflammation, stimulate toxin production, and damage the integrity of the gut epithelial barrier. PD patients' intestinal microflora were characterised by a diminished abundance of Lachnospiraceae, which was positively correlated with PD progress, cognitive decline, and impaired motor functions. These microbiome's compositional changes correlate well with some metabolic switches. PD microbiota show reduced SCFAs production, decreased carbohydrate fermentation, and augmented proteolytic fermentation. Chen et al. demonstrated that the SCFA level was relevant to microbiota composition changes and the clinical severity of PD. The levels of SCFAs acetate, butyrate, and propionate in fecal samples of PD patients were significantly reduced, contrary to their elevated concentration in plasma. Rodent models of PD disease have shown a positive effect of SCFAs on behavior and PD symptoms. Butyrate, as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, exerts neuroprotective activity, reducing dopaminergic cell death, and motor impairment, and improving cognitive functions. Taken together, SCFAs play an important role in protection from PD disease and could be proposed as representative gut-oriented indicators for diversifying individuals with PD and placing disease progression.",16553034.0,987,to5CIDU5Y8,inflammation,1310.0,1322.0,Disease,2387.0,2392.0,SCFAs,Chemical,None

"In summary, the gut microbiota generates a series of bioactive metabolites to interact with host metabolism. These metabolites mainly include SCFAs, primary and secondary BAs, TMAO, and so on. Among these metabolites, some exert synergistic effects to promote host health by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system to control glucose metabolism. For example, SCFAs interact with human hormones such as GLP-1 and PYY to effect energy uptake and the development of obesity. SCFAs are beneficial for regulating appetite and energy intake, and preventing the formation of atherosclerosis. Other metabolites, such as TMAO and phenylacetylglutamine (PAGln), may be toxic. For example, TMAO may be proatherogenic to promote the process of thrombosis and atherosclerosis, thereby increasing the risk of cardiovascular events. Patients with CVDs had lower levels of SCFA generation and higher levels of TMAO production due to the change in gut microbiota. Furthermore, TMAO causes vascular endothelial damage and promotes the production of atherosclerotic plaques. TMAO can also increase the release of intracellular calcium ions, enhance the reactivity of platelets, and increase the risk of thrombosis to increase CVDs susceptibility. Besides, PAGln enhances platelet reactivity and thrombosis, leading to CVDs. Taken together, mounting evidence suggests that changes in gut microbiota metabolites are part of the crucial mechanisms by which the gut microbiota regulates the occurrence and development of CVDs.",18055127.0,1164,1154,CVDs,839.0,843.0,Disease,901.0,905.0,TMAO,Chemical,increase

One study indicated that three BCAAs (leucine, isoleucine, and valine), and two aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine and tyrosine) were significantly increased 10 years before the onset of diabetes. The increased BCAAs-induced insulin resistance was associated with the presence of Prevotella copri and Bacteroides vulgatus. The major groups of gut bacteria that biosynthesize BCAAs are Prevotella copri and Bacteroides vulgatus, and the insulin resistance caused by elevated BCAAs levels is associated with the presence of these two bacteria.

"SCFAs may prevent obesity by regulating the homeostasis of glucose and lipid metabolism. For instance, acetate decreases appetite and nutrient intake. Propionate activates intestinal gluconeogenesis by a gut-brain neural circuit to promote energy balance. Butyrate provides energy for colon cells, maintains the integrity of intestinal walls, and improves the insulin response, which activates gluconeogenesis to maintain the balance of glucose and energy through the cAMP pathway. And one study indicated that oral butyrate intake prevents obesity and insulin resistance. Furthermore, the role of SCFAs in metabolic hemostasis is related to other factors. Adenosine monophosphate activating protein (AMPK) is a heterotrimeric enzyme that stimulates liver and muscle fatty acid oxidation pathways. SCFAs promote the activity of AMPK and improve its ability to oxidize fatty acids. Last, SCFAs can affect the development of dyslipidemia. SCFAs increase the expression of fasting-induced adipose factor (FIAF), a circulating lipoprotein lipase inhibitor, by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-gamma), thereby decreasing the activity of lipoproteinases and inhibiting lipolysis in adipose tissues.

"The function of the gut microbiota is closely related to the risk of CVDs. Specifically, an impaired mucosal barrier, overactivated inflammation, and immune dysfunction are crucial steps in the development of CVDs triggered by gut microbiota dysbiosis. The structural constituents of gram-negative bacteria, such as LPS, are the main reason for endotoxemia and impaired intestinal mucosal barrier function. It has been reported that LPS is important in the development of cardiometabolic diseases. Moreover, studies showed that the high-fat diet could result in decreased intestinal levels of gram-positive Bifidobacteria and increased LPS-containing gut microbiota which further leads to obesity, the main risk factor for CVDs. Importantly, continuous subcutaneous infusion of LPS showed a tendency to cause the change of glucose metabolism and the pattern of weight gain was similar to that seen when taking a high-fat diet. Therefore, intestinal dysbiosis and the corresponding change in metabolites lead to abnormal nutrient metabolism, insulin resistance, and increased adipose tissue storage, which increases the risk of cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity and diabetes.

"At the end of this chapter, it is worth mentioning the fact that the interaction between the microbiome and the host is bidirectional, and some metabolic changes, which could be a pathological result of disease progression, also influence microbiome metabolism. A good example is a disturbance in cholesterol homeostasis, which correlates with an augmented probability of Alzheimer's disease occurrence. In addition, alteration of the intestinal microbiota composition with the subsequent fluctuations in the serum and brain levels of bile acids (BAs) is involved in the development of AD. BAs can act as detergents, affecting BBB permeability, and incrementing brain influx of peripheral cholesterol and BAs. Therefore, proper cholesterol elimination pathways play a crucial role in AD prevention and treatment. The gut microbiome is a main ""organ"" metabolizing secondary bile acids. Peripheral cholesterol is eliminated mainly through its liver conversion to BAs. The gut microbiota performs BA transformation via deconjugation and dehydroxylation, leading to secondary BA formation. Nho et al. investigated the correlation between neurodegeneration and BAs, B-amyloid, and tau protein concentration. The application of targeted metabolomics enabled the determination of the association between intestinal microbiota-derived secondary bile acids and sera BAs. Interestingly, the analysis indicated an imbalanced BA ratio, underlying an increased amount of secondary BAs over primary ones. Another clinical study confirmed the correlation between bile acid metabolic profile and the prevalence of AD and mild cognitive impairment, showing similar BA ratio disruptions. Decreased cognitive functions were positively associated with increased concentrations of secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid, and glycolithocholic acid.

"Scientific evidence indicates that the metabolic status of microbiota exerts a more important role than the equilibrium between bacterial species. Microbial metabolites can act as positive modulators of the gut-brain-axis constituents, boosting the immune cells and exerting a positive/protective effect on neurodegenerative disease progression. On the other hand, disrupted equilibrium between microbial species often leads to specific switches in the microbial metabolome, which may be harmful and associated with neurodegenerative disease progression. For example, dysregulation of Gram-negative bacteria in the gastrointestinal area leads to the production of harmful metabolites (i.e., endo- and exotoxins, saccharides, and amyloids). Exotoxins, such as LPS, which have the ability to activate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, exert negative effects. LPS belongs to glycolipid molecules, mostly produced by Gram-negative bacterial strains. These molecules participate in the integrity maintenance of the bacterial outer-membrane permeability barrier, playing an important role in host-pathogen interplay. The overproduction of bacterial LPS can cause the activation of the macrophage-monocyte nod-like receptor P3 inflammasome, therefore stimulating the production of cytokines with pro-inflammatory activity, such as IL-18 or IL-1beta. LPS can be translocated and intensify neuroinflammatory diseases such as AD. Additionally, it was demonstrated that IL-1beta can decrease the phagocytic function of microglial cells, stimulating the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, and causing reduced synaptic plasticity and cognitive deterioration. These cytokines can induce microbiota dysregulation, increasing gut permeability and influencing gut bacteria diversity.",16508033.0,W1J0Q1ttsT,2e5h_Ceng3,microbial species,395.0,412.0,Species,759.0,763.0,"LPS,",Chemical,None
"However host-microbiota interplay is not exclusively restricted to cell-cell interactions. Intestinal microbes are capable of producing a plethora of different types of compounds, i.e., small molecules (amino acids, neurotransmitters, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and other fatty acid derivatives, indoles, vitamins, and cofactors), polysaccharides, and proteins (i.e., bacteriocins), which have been reported as important factors in shaping the bacterial community and modulation of the immune system. It has been demonstrated that intestinal bacterial strains such as Escherichia coli or Lactobacillus spp. interact directly with the host's CNS (central nervous system), as they can release neurotransmitters such as dopamine, noradrenaline, histamine, acetylcholine, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), or serotonin. This metabolic status of the microbiome is also vulnerable to dysbiosis and compositional changes and often leads to metabolic disturbances. For example, dysbiosis can induce elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, intensifying oxidative stress and neuronal inflammatory processes. It has been estimated that 40% of the metabolites detected in humans are the products of bacterial metabolism, which plays a fundamental role in the modulation of the host's physiological processes, including immune-mediated neurodegeneration or affecting neural cell metabolism.",16115776.0,127,119,Escherichia coli,573.0,589.0,Species,773.0,777.0,GABA,Chemical,start

"In fact, changes in the function of gut microecology and gut microbiota may cause the occurrence and exacerbation of various diseases. It was found that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota may lead to decreased cardiac function and increased cardiomyopathy as well as cardiac insufficiency, which is of great significance in predicting CVDs and also has important predictive significance for the prognosis of adverse cardiovascular events. The gut microbiota has been reported to be associated with CVDs and its corresponding risk factors, such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, and insulin resistance. These risk factors may affect the composition and the diversity of gut microbiota. In addition, gut dysbiosis is also linked to inflammation, oxidative stress, platelet activity, thrombosis and atherosclerosis, which contribute to the progression of CVDs. The possible mechanism of gut microbiota dysbiosis related to CVDs includes its role in increasing intestinal permeability and triggering inflammation via the LPS/TLR4 as well as NLRP3 pathways, thereby ultimately contributing to the development of CVDs.

"Mechanically, current studies suggest that SCFAs may exert their functions through acting as energy substrates and maintaining metabolic integration by a variety of different downstream regulatory mechanisms, such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPRs) with GPR41/Recombinant Free Fatty Acid Receptor (FFAR3), GPR43/FFAR2, GPR109A, Olfactory Receptors 78 (Olfr78) in endocrine cells of the gut wall, as well as histone deacetylases (HDACs) (Fig. 2). GPR41 regulates host energy acquisition and promotes the catabolism of glucose and lipids. The decreased SCFAs may cause less activated GPR41 and higher levels of energy uptake. In addition, it has also been reported that the lower production of SCFAs in gut microbiota would increase the host's capability of obtaining energy from the diet. SCFAs from bacterial fermentation promote the secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY) through GPR43 and GPR41 from intestinal L cells. GLP-1 increased pancreatic insulin secretion, and inhibited the production of glucagon.

"The mechanism by which BCAAs induce insulin resistance is still not fully understood. The rise of BCAA levels is found to regulate glycolipid metabolism, cause insulin resistance, and increase the risk of T2D. Other animal experiments have shown that elevated BCAAs are transferred to skeletal muscle, and are interfered with lipid metabolism, which causes the accumulation of lipid metabolites and ultimately leads to skeletal muscle insulin resistance. Additionally, BCAAs are the key regulatory factor of mTORC1. It activates mTORC1 and ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (S6K1) by inducing the phosphorylation of IRS1, blocking the insulin signaling pathway, and eventually causing insulin resistance. However, 2 other studies have shown that BCAAs may exert their functions without mTORC1. One study reported that the metabolites of BCAAs, 3-hydroxy isobutyrate, could cause insulin resistance by promoting skeletal muscle sprouting.

"Given that the gut microbiota is essential in human health, changes in the composition and function of the gut microbiota may result in the development of diseases. Due to the influence of host genes, diet, antibiotic use, lifestyle, drugs as well as other factors, the composition and diversity of gut microbiota gradually change with interindividual variation. For example, a high-fat diet leads to an increase in the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. When the composition and proportion of gut microbiota change, inflammation and metabolic abnormalities can be induced, which contribute to the development of different diseases. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota refers to changes in the number, species and composition of gut microbiota.

"SCFAs may prevent obesity by regulating the homeostasis of glucose and lipid metabolism. For instance, acetate decreases appetite and nutrient intake.

"It remains unclear how the gut microbiota and BAs profiles interact with each other and whether the interaction is associated with obesity. Mice fed BAs exhibited obesity and a composition change in the obesity-associated gut microbiota, which is similar to high-fat diet-fed mice. Under a high-fat diet, the concentration of intestinal BAs increases, and the composition of gut microbiota alternates. For example, the increased BAs are the main reason for the marked increase in the abundance of the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. Another study has shown that BAs and a high-fat diet promote the growth of Bilophila wadsworthia in mice, and secondary BAs produced by Bilophila spp. have been shown to induce obesity. What's more, it has been reported that the low capacity of microbiota to metabolize Tauro-beta-muricholic acid, a primary BA, might increase the risk of obesity and insulin resistance. Therefore, BAs profiles affect the composition of gut microbiota, and gut microbiota also regulates the production and ratio of different BAs to play an important role in obesity susceptibility.",18109315.0,h2KZh4KEqn,2FVbAxTXze,gut microbiota,977.0,991.0,Species,1045.0,1048.0,BAs,Chemical,improve
"BAs, as by-products of cholesterol metabolism, are the main organic component of bile and are synthesized in hepatocytes. Cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) are primary BAs directly synthesized from cholesterol; secondary BAs include deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholic acid (LCA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and their glycine and taurine conjugated forms. BAs are excreted into the intestine to aid in the digestion and absorption of lipids and combine with farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and takeda-G-protein receptor 5 (TGR5) (Fig. 2). There is a strong biochemical relationship between BAs and gut microbiota. Some gut microbiota in healthy people can convert conjugated BAs into free BAs, and can transform BAs into secondary BAs with the help of bile salt hydrolase (BSH) and cholesterol 7-alpha hydroxy-lase (CYP7A1), so as to reduce blood cholesterol by affecting the enterohepatic circulation of BAs. Besides, the gut microbiota affects the metabolism of BAs by regulating the activity of BSH to reduce LDL cholesterol levels. BAs have bacteriostatic properties and an antimicrobial effect. BAs destroy the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane and thereby change the intestinal microecology. BAs also prevent bacteria from overgrowth and decrease inflammation. More importantly, BAs are also closely associated with CVDs. For example, BAs levels in the feces of patients with CVDs are different from those in healthy individuals. And BAs have been reported to regulate vascular tension and affect ion exchange on cardiomyocyte membranes, suggesting that regulating BAs by gut microbiota might be a treatment for CVDs.",17301489.0,854,3PVUVBgpdq,Cholic acid,122.0,133.0,Chemical,176.0,187.0,primary BAs,Chemical,part_of

"Scientific evidence indicates that the metabolic status of microbiota exerts a more important role than the equilibrium between bacterial species. Microbial metabolites can act as positive modulators of the gut-brain-axis constituents, boosting the immune cells and exerting a positive/protective effect on neurodegenerative disease progression. On the other hand, disrupted equilibrium between microbial species often leads to specific switches in the microbial metabolome, which may be harmful and associated with neurodegenerative disease progression. For example, dysregulation of Gram-negative bacteria in the gastrointestinal area leads to the production of harmful metabolites (i.e., endo- and exotoxins, saccharides, and amyloids). Exotoxins, such as LPS, which have the ability to activate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, exert negative effects. LPS belongs to glycolipid molecules, mostly produced by Gram-negative bacterial strains. These molecules participate in the integrity maintenance of the bacterial outer-membrane permeability barrier, playing an important role in host-pathogen interplay. The overproduction of bacterial LPS can cause the activation of the macrophage-monocyte nod-like receptor P3 inflammasome, therefore stimulating the production of cytokines with pro-inflammatory activity, such as IL-18 or IL-1beta. LPS can be translocated and intensify neuroinflammatory diseases such as AD. Additionally, it was demonstrated that IL-1beta can decrease the phagocytic function of microglial cells, stimulating the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, and causing reduced synaptic plasticity and cognitive deterioration. These cytokines can induce microbiota dysregulation, increasing gut permeability and influencing gut bacteria diversity.",16508033.0,302,faqreaSC6j,IL-1beta,1471.0,1479.0,Gene,1520.0,1536.0,microglial cells,Cellline,decrease
"The function of the gut microbiota is closely related to the risk of CVDs. Specifically, an impaired mucosal barrier, overactivated inflammation, and immune dysfunction are crucial steps in the development of CVDs triggered by gut microbiota dysbiosis. The structural constituents of gram-negative bacteria, such as LPS, are the main reason for endotoxemia and impaired intestinal mucosal barrier function. It has been reported that LPS is important in the development of cardiometabolic diseases. Moreover, studies showed that the high-fat diet could result in decreased intestinal levels of gram-positive Bifidobacteria and increased LPS-containing gut microbiota which further leads to obesity, the main risk factor for CVDs. Importantly, continuous subcutaneous infusion of LPS showed a tendency to cause the change of glucose metabolism and the pattern of weight gain was similar to that seen when taking a high-fat diet. Therefore, intestinal dysbiosis and the corresponding change in metabolites lead to abnormal nutrient metabolism, insulin resistance, and increased adipose tissue storage, which increases the risk of cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity and diabetes.

Furthermore, the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota triggers intestinal mucosal barrier damage, leading to inflammation and disordered nutrient metabolism.

Given that information, we summarized the latest advances in the current research regarding the effect of gut microbiota on health, the main cardiovascular risk factors, and CVDs, highlighted the roles and mechanisms of several metabolites, and introduced corresponding promising treatments for CVDs regarding the gut microbiota.

In mechanism, TMAO enhances platelet hyperreactivity by altering Ca2+ signaling and elicits a pro-thrombotic effect. Especially, TMAO seems to induce systemic inflammation that contributes to CAD progression.

"Recently, bacterial strains producing SCFAs have gained extreme popularity. SCFAs are small organic monocarboxylic acids, released after the fermentation of indigestible alimentary fiber (mainly galacto- or fructooligosaccharides), plant-derived polysaccharides, or the metabolism of amino acids, and are considered a key gut-derived metabolites with beneficial health effects and as essential in gut-brain crosstalk. The type of formed SCFAs is correlated with the kind of fiber ingested and the overall gut microbiota population. For example, microbes belonging to Firmicutes phyla (e.g., Lachnospiraceae, Eubacterium, or Roseburia belonging to the Clostridia class) are responsible for the main production of butyrate, whereas Bifidobacteria spp. produce lactate and acetate. SCFAs are significantly reduced during dysbiosis, where disrupted gut epithelial integrity, inflammation, and altered microbiome metabolic processes occur. In a healthy colon, levels of SCFAs can vary depending on a diet; however, in multiple diseases, these levels are altered. SCFAs may also act in an indirect or direct way through G-protein-coupled receptors or as histone deacetylase epigenetic modulators. They participate in various physiological processes, such as cell energetics and colonocyte metabolism and skeletal, adipose, and liver tissue modulation. Their major functions comprise the activation of trophic factors, energy management, and the manufacturing of regulatory T-cells.

"It is currently controversial whether supplementation with BCAAs would increase circulating BCAAs, thereby increasing the risk of diabetes. And reducing BCAAs intake promotes fat mass loss and insulin sensitivity in mice with obesity. A high BCAAs diet causes excessive feeding, mainly due to excessive appetite. Adding threonine to balance the composition of amino acids in the diet can inhibit food intake. Nevertheless, some studies have found that supplementary BCAAs, such as isoleucine and leucine, can improve insulin resistance and reduce weight to lower the risk of obesity and diabetes. The inconsistency may be due to the individual state of energy excess or energy deficiency. In terms of an excessive energy state, such as in patients with obesity or diabetes who have an impaired ability to degrade BCAAs, BCAAs and related metabolites accumulate in circulation to reduce insulin sensitivity and cause insulin resistance. In most elderly people with inadequate energy or athletes who maintain good fitness habits, BCAAs can improve the form of metabolism. In these people, BCAAs decomposition metabolism is increased by regulatory factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha coactivator (PGC-1alpha) and PPARalpha, so that BCAAs levels are maintained in a steady state, which ultimately promotes glucose intake and insulin sensitivity. This was supported by the study of Newgard, who pointed out that dietary intake of BCAAs might interact with a high-fat diet to induce abnormal metabolic phenotypes such as insulin resistance. Mice fed BCAAs alone did not develop insulin resistance. However, when mice were fed a high-fat diet supplemented with BCAAs, they developed insulin resistance. This study suggested that BCAAs only lead to insulin resistance in the presence of excess energy intake. Therefore, more studies are needed to explore the supplementation with BCAAs and insulin resistance as well as the development of cardiovascular risk factors.",19341206.0,2469,2453,obesity,753.0,760.0,Disease,813.0,818.0,BCAAs,Chemical,decrease
"The PD microbiome has a diminished variety of bacterial taxonomic groups, especially the ones associated with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects and the increase of phyla, which has toxic effects. Predominantly, the reduction was observed in the Lachnospiraceae family, including Butyrivibrio, Pseudobutyrivibrio, Coprococcus, Blautia and SCFAs-producing Prevotellaceae. The increased amount of Enterobacteriaceae is linked to the severity of postural instability and walking difficulties. Moreover, the PD microbiome is characterised by increased Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium species and decreased amount of Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae. The overgrowth of Akkermansia spp. in PD patients may be strain-specific and can be related to immune-response alterations, decreased mucus thicknesses, and increased constipation. Faecalibacterium family is a crucial player producing SCFAs and anti-inflammatory metabolites, maintaining gut health. Faecalibacterium balance disturbances can lead to impaired gut-barrier function, increasing the risk of infection with enteric pathogens and boosting alpha-synuclein formation. Similarly, the Lachnospiraceae family can produce butyrate, important for the proper function of the gut epithelium. Decreased Lachnospiraceae quantity might aggravate gut inflammation, stimulate toxin production, and damage the integrity of the gut epithelial barrier. PD patients' intestinal microflora were characterised by a diminished abundance of Lachnospiraceae, which was positively correlated with PD progress, cognitive decline, and impaired motor functions. These microbiome's compositional changes correlate well with some metabolic switches. PD microbiota show reduced SCFAs production, decreased carbohydrate fermentation, and augmented proteolytic fermentation. Chen et al. demonstrated that the SCFA level was relevant to microbiota composition changes and the clinical severity of PD. The levels of SCFAs acetate, butyrate, and propionate in fecal samples of PD patients were significantly reduced, contrary to their elevated concentration in plasma. Rodent models of PD disease have shown a positive effect of SCFAs on behavior and PD symptoms. Butyrate, as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, exerts neuroprotective activity, reducing dopaminergic cell death, and motor impairment, and improving cognitive functions. Taken together, SCFAs play an important role in protection from PD disease and could be proposed as representative gut-oriented indicators for diversifying individuals with PD and placing disease progression.",16553034.0,1Knqgo5f58,1vDTIjusqi,Prevotellaceae,366.0,380.0,Species,257.0,272.0,Lachnospiraceae,Species,part_of
"Recent evidence has demonstrated the importance of the gut microbiota in the formation and development of the immune system. The gut microbiota has profound effects on the formation of lymphoid tissue and the development of the immune system.

The structural components of gut microbiota such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), flagella, and peptidoglycan, can interact with receptors on human cells to stimulate and guide the host immune response. For instance, LPS binds to Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, flagella binds to TLR5, and peptidoglycan binds to TLR2, triggering the expression of a large number of downstream inflammatory factors, thereby affecting the cardiovascular system.

"SCFAs may prevent obesity by regulating the homeostasis of glucose and lipid metabolism. For instance, acetate decreases appetite and nutrient intake. Propionate activates intestinal gluconeogenesis by a gut-brain neural circuit to promote energy balance. Butyrate provides energy for colon cells, maintains the integrity of intestinal walls, and improves the insulin response, which activates gluconeogenesis to maintain the balance of glucose and energy through the cAMP pathway. And one study indicated that oral butyrate intake prevents obesity and insulin resistance. Furthermore, the role of SCFAs in metabolic hemostasis is related to other factors. Adenosine monophosphate activating protein (AMPK) is a heterotrimeric enzyme that stimulates liver and muscle fatty acid oxidation pathways. SCFAs promote the activity of AMPK and improve its ability to oxidize fatty acids. Last, SCFAs can affect the development of dyslipidemia. SCFAs increase the expression of fasting-induced adipose factor (FIAF), a circulating lipoprotein lipase inhibitor, by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-gamma), thereby decreasing the activity of lipoproteinases and inhibiting lipolysis in adipose tissues.

"The health of the gut microbiome can vary depending on various factors including diet (e.g., ingestion of saturated/unsaturated dietary fats, vitamins, minerals, dairy products, alcoholic beverages, polyphenols containing food such as cocoa-rich chocolate, tea, or coffee), dietary patterns, geographical area, and diet-related habits (sometimes varying between males and females) and sex (the influence of sex hormones). A positive correlation between polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (N-3 PUFA), and alpha-linolenic acid (aLNA) ingestion and protection against PD development in dose-response trends was demonstrated. American studies demonstrated that PUFA replacement with increased animal fat intake (Western Diet) significantly increased the risk of PD in males only. Excessive animal fat intake can promote dysbiosis and the production of harmful microbial metabolites, which can increase the prevalence of the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, sex differences are implicated in the mental health and prevalence of psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, and neurodegenerative disorders. It has been demonstrated that PD patients usually have altered microbiome compositions compared with controls. Similar to AD, many sex differences in PD are correlated with the protective nature of estrogens, as they are impacted by the gut-brain axis and protect against oxidative damage, thereby supporting dopaminergic function. It has been demonstrated that at age 45, the estimated overall lifetime risk for AD is about 20% for females and 10% for males, which is followed by a disruption in the patient's gut microbiota composition.

"However host-microbiota interplay is not exclusively restricted to cell-cell interactions. Intestinal microbes are capable of producing a plethora of different types of compounds, i.e., small molecules (amino acids, neurotransmitters, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and other fatty acid derivatives, indoles, vitamins, and cofactors), polysaccharides, and proteins (i.e., bacteriocins), which have been reported as important factors in shaping the bacterial community and modulation of the immune system. It has been demonstrated that intestinal bacterial strains such as Escherichia coli or Lactobacillus spp. interact directly with the host's CNS (central nervous system), as they can release neurotransmitters such as dopamine, noradrenaline, histamine, acetylcholine, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), or serotonin. This metabolic status of the microbiome is also vulnerable to dysbiosis and compositional changes and often leads to metabolic disturbances. For example, dysbiosis can induce elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, intensifying oxidative stress and neuronal inflammatory processes.

HD microbiota composition indicated dysbiosis, disturbances in cytokine levels, and an increase in sulphur metabolism characterized by hydrogen sulphide overproduction and negatively influencing gut health. Ultimately, the gut dysbiosis state was also described in a transgenic mice model representing Huntington's disease. Kong et al. found increased Bacteroidetes and decreased Firmicutes levels in a R6/1 transgenic mice model.

"At the end of this chapter, it is worth mentioning the fact that the interaction between the microbiome and the host is bidirectional, and some metabolic changes, which could be a pathological result of disease progression, also influence microbiome metabolism. A good example is a disturbance in cholesterol homeostasis, which correlates with an augmented probability of Alzheimer's disease occurrence. In addition, alteration of the intestinal microbiota composition with the subsequent fluctuations in the serum and brain levels of bile acids (BAs) is involved in the development of AD. BAs can act as detergents, affecting BBB permeability, and incrementing brain influx of peripheral cholesterol and BAs. Therefore, proper cholesterol elimination pathways play a crucial role in AD prevention and treatment. The gut microbiome is a main ""organ"" metabolizing secondary bile acids. Peripheral cholesterol is eliminated mainly through its liver conversion to BAs. The gut microbiota performs BA transformation via deconjugation and dehydroxylation, leading to secondary BA formation. Nho et al. investigated the correlation between neurodegeneration and BAs, B-amyloid, and tau protein concentration. The application of targeted metabolomics enabled the determination of the association between intestinal microbiota-derived secondary bile acids and sera BAs. Interestingly, the analysis indicated an imbalanced BA ratio, underlying an increased amount of secondary BAs over primary ones. Another clinical study confirmed the correlation between bile acid metabolic profile and the prevalence of AD and mild cognitive impairment, showing similar BA ratio disruptions. Decreased cognitive functions were positively associated with increased concentrations of secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid, and glycolithocholic acid.

"Experimental research confirms the hypothesis regarding SCFA reduction in autoimmune diseases (MS among others) and altered gut microbiota. A low level of SCFAs dysregulates Treg cell functions, leading to insufficient immune tolerance towards endogenous components and enteric microbiota. However, this process can be reversed by SCFAs supplementation (e.g., propionic acid). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing NFkappaB activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation and on microglial cells in vitro. TUDCA binds to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) expressed in microglial cells. This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS). Experimental results demonstrated that TUDCA acted as a double-edged sword, triggering microglia enhancement in anti-inflammatory and alternatively activated markers and on the other hand reducing the infiltration of macrophages and microglia with expressed pro-inflammatory markers. Interestingly, during neuroinflammation, microglial cells change their morphology, converting themselves into reactive macrophage-like forms. However, microglial cells are flexible, as they can sometimes polarize towards alternatively activated phenotypes, promoting CNS pathologies (proinflammatory or M1 microglia), or exert anti-inflammatory effects, boosting cell repair and remodeling. Bile acids were identified as nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor agonists, leading to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) depletion (in a mouse model) and neuroinflammatory process adjustment. The administration of the complex probiotic positively influenced the intestinal flora balance in patients diagnosed with MS. The probiotic prevented the onset of dysbiosis, significantly increasing the amount of Methanobrevibacter and Akkermansia, Prevotella, and Sutterella in MS patients, influencing gene expression and the production of beneficial bacterial metabolites.",16224291.0,1300,pYwHIUfPkw,IL-10,1329.0,1334.0,Species,1285.0,1294.0,cytokines,Species,part_of

"The function of the gut microbiota is closely related to the risk of CVDs. Specifically, an impaired mucosal barrier, overactivated inflammation, and immune dysfunction are crucial steps in the development of CVDs triggered by gut microbiota dysbiosis. The structural constituents of gram-negative bacteria, such as LPS, are the main reason for endotoxemia and impaired intestinal mucosal barrier function. It has been reported that LPS is important in the development of cardiometabolic diseases. Moreover, studies showed that the high-fat diet could result in decreased intestinal levels of gram-positive Bifidobacteria and increased LPS-containing gut microbiota which further leads to obesity, the main risk factor for CVDs. Importantly, continuous subcutaneous infusion of LPS showed a tendency to cause the change of glucose metabolism and the pattern of weight gain was similar to that seen when taking a high-fat diet. Therefore, intestinal dysbiosis and the corresponding change in metabolites lead to abnormal nutrient metabolism, insulin resistance, and increased adipose tissue storage, which increases the risk of cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity and diabetes. Herein, we take obesity and diabetes as examples to explain the effect of gut microbiota on cardiovascular risk factors (Fig. 3).",18057704.0,TziqcXpyno,1302,LPS,433.0,436.0,Chemical,472.0,496.0,cardiometabolic diseases,Disease,Marker/Mechanism

"Aromatic amino acids including tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine are metabolized into indole and phenols by certain intestinal anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, and Peptostreptococcus. Tryptophan is decomposed into indole, indoleacetic acid, indole-3-lactic acid, 3-methylindole (skatole) and other indole compounds under the action of tryptophanase. Tryptophanase is the key enzyme that generates indole. The activity of the enzyme is easily induced by the substrate tryptophan, so when the amount of tryptophan changes in the colonic environment, the content of indole will fluctuate greatly. Of note, the metabolic products of aromatic amino acids generated by gut microbiota have a great impact on the pathology of cardiometabolic diseases. For example, indole propionic acid is associated with insulin sensitivity and appears to reduce the risk of diabetes. Moreover, the gut microbiota metabolizes dietary tryptophan to indoxyl, which further generates indoxyl sulfate through sulfonation. Excessive accumulation of indoxyl sulfate causes cardiomyocyte damage and increases thrombus formation. Another phenol compound, 4-methylphenol, can inhibit the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into mature adipocytes, induce apoptosis and reduce glucose uptake.

"Mechanically, current studies suggest that SCFAs may exert their functions through acting as energy substrates and maintaining metabolic integration by a variety of different downstream regulatory mechanisms, such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPRs) with GPR41/Recombinant Free Fatty Acid Receptor (FFAR3), GPR43/FFAR2, GPR109A, Olfactory Receptors 78 (Olfr78) in endocrine cells of the gut wall, as well as histone deacetylases (HDACs) (Fig. 2). GPR41 regulates host energy acquisition and promotes the catabolism of glucose and lipids. The decreased SCFAs may cause less activated GPR41 and higher levels of energy uptake. In addition, it has also been reported that the lower production of SCFAs in gut microbiota would increase the host's capability of obtaining energy from the diet. SCFAs from bacterial fermentation promote the secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY) through GPR43 and GPR41 from intestinal L cells. GLP-1 increased pancreatic insulin secretion, and inhibited the production of glucagon. Deletion of GLP-1 abolished the beneficial effects of prebiotics on weight gain, glucose metabolism, and inflammatory pathway activation.

"Recently, bacterial strains producing SCFAs have gained extreme popularity. SCFAs are small organic monocarboxylic acids, released after the fermentation of indigestible alimentary fiber (mainly galacto- or fructooligosaccharides), plant-derived polysaccharides, or the metabolism of amino acids, and are considered a key gut-derived metabolites with beneficial health effects and as essential in gut-brain crosstalk. The type of formed SCFAs is correlated with the kind of fiber ingested and the overall gut microbiota population. For example, microbes belonging to Firmicutes phyla (e.g., Lachnospiraceae, Eubacterium, or Roseburia belonging to the Clostridia class) are responsible for the main production of butyrate, whereas Bifidobacteria spp. produce lactate and acetate. SCFAs are significantly reduced during dysbiosis, where disrupted gut epithelial integrity, inflammation, and altered microbiome metabolic processes occur. In a healthy colon, levels of SCFAs can vary depending on a diet; however, in multiple diseases, these levels are altered. SCFAs may also act in an indirect or direct way through G-protein-coupled receptors or as histone deacetylase epigenetic modulators. They participate in various physiological processes, such as cell energetics and colonocyte metabolism and skeletal, adipose, and liver tissue modulation. Their major functions comprise the activation of trophic factors, energy management, and the manufacturing of regulatory T-cells.

"It remains unclear how the gut microbiota and BAs profiles interact with each other and whether the interaction is associated with obesity. Mice fed BAs exhibited obesity and a composition change in the obesity-associated gut microbiota, which is similar to high-fat diet-fed mice. Under a high-fat diet, the concentration of intestinal BAs increases, and the composition of gut microbiota alternates. For example, the increased BAs are the main reason for the marked increase in the abundance of the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. Another study has shown that BAs and a high-fat diet promote the growth of Bilophila wadsworthia in mice, and secondary BAs produced by Bilophila spp. have been shown to induce obesity. What's more, it has been reported that the low capacity of microbiota to metabolize Tauro-beta-muricholic acid, a primary BA, might increase the risk of obesity and insulin resistance.

"The PD microbiome has a diminished variety of bacterial taxonomic groups, especially the ones associated with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects and the increase of phyla, which has toxic effects. Predominantly, the reduction was observed in the Lachnospiraceae family, including Butyrivibrio, Pseudobutyrivibrio, Coprococcus, Blautia and SCFAs-producing Prevotellaceae. The increased amount of Enterobacteriaceae is linked to the severity of postural instability and walking difficulties. Moreover, the PD microbiome is characterised by increased Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium species and decreased amount of Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae. The overgrowth of Akkermansia spp. in PD patients may be strain-specific and can be related to immune-response alterations, decreased mucus thicknesses, and increased constipation. Faecalibacterium family is a crucial player producing SCFAs and anti-inflammatory metabolites, maintaining gut health. Faecalibacterium balance disturbances can lead to impaired gut-barrier function, increasing the risk of infection with enteric pathogens and boosting alpha-synuclein formation. Similarly, the Lachnospiraceae family can produce butyrate, important for the proper function of the gut epithelium. Decreased Lachnospiraceae quantity might aggravate gut inflammation, stimulate toxin production, and damage the integrity of the gut epithelial barrier. PD patients' intestinal microflora were characterised by a diminished abundance of Lachnospiraceae, which was positively correlated with PD progress, cognitive decline, and impaired motor functions. These microbiome's compositional changes correlate well with some metabolic switches. PD microbiota show reduced SCFAs production, decreased carbohydrate fermentation, and augmented proteolytic fermentation. Chen et al. demonstrated that the SCFA level was relevant to microbiota composition changes and the clinical severity of PD. The levels of SCFAs acetate, butyrate, and propionate in fecal samples of PD patients were significantly reduced, contrary to their elevated concentration in plasma. Rodent models of PD disease have shown a positive effect of SCFAs on behavior and PD symptoms. Butyrate, as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, exerts neuroprotective activity, reducing dopaminergic cell death, and motor impairment, and improving cognitive functions.

A low level of SCFAs dysregulates Treg cell functions, leading to insufficient immune tolerance towards endogenous components and enteric microbiota. However, this process can be reversed by SCFAs supplementation (e.g., propionic acid). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing NFkappaB activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation and on microglial cells in vitro. TUDCA binds to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) expressed in microglial cells. This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS). Experimental results demonstrated that TUDCA acted as a double-edged sword, triggering microglia enhancement in anti-inflammatory and alternatively activated markers and on the other hand reducing the infiltration of macrophages and microglia with expressed pro-inflammatory markers.

"The origins of Parkinson's disease are the result of many factors such as increased age, polygenic factors (disease-segregating mutations in alpha-synuclein protein occurring in 15% of PD patients), toxins, and infectious agents. In 2006, Braak et al. assumed the gut-related origins of Parkinson's disease. One of the key pathological hallmarks of PD is Lewy bodies, being eosinophilic inclusion forms of misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates. Importantly, alpha-synuclein protein has a tendency to misfold and form aggregates. Its accumulation has been detected during bacterial and viral infections in the gut. Moreover, it can be recognized as a characteristic indicator of PD neural degeneration. This protein aggregate can boost the local immune response.

"BAs, as by-products of cholesterol metabolism, are the main organic component of bile and are synthesized in hepatocytes. Cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) are primary BAs directly synthesized from cholesterol; secondary BAs include deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholic acid (LCA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and their glycine and taurine conjugated forms. BAs are excreted into the intestine to aid in the digestion and absorption of lipids and combine with farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and takeda-G-protein receptor 5 (TGR5) (Fig. 2). There is a strong biochemical relationship between BAs and gut microbiota. Some gut microbiota in healthy people can convert conjugated BAs into free BAs, and can transform BAs into secondary BAs with the help of bile salt hydrolase (BSH) and cholesterol 7-alpha hydroxy-lase (CYP7A1), so as to reduce blood cholesterol by affecting the enterohepatic circulation of BAs. Besides, the gut microbiota affects the metabolism of BAs by regulating the activity of BSH to reduce LDL cholesterol levels. BAs have bacteriostatic properties and an antimicrobial effect. BAs destroy the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane and thereby change the intestinal microecology. BAs also prevent bacteria from overgrowth and decrease inflammation. More importantly, BAs are also closely associated with CVDs. For example, BAs levels in the feces of patients with CVDs are different from those in healthy individuals.

"Trillions of microorganisms colonize the anaerobic and nutritious environment in the gut to form a healthy intestinal physiological ecosystem. These communities are regarded as ""gut microbiota"", and the sum total of all microorganism genomes in the gut, including their DNA sequences and other genetic information, are together called ""gut microbiomes"". Most intestinal microbial communities in the human intestinal tract are bacteria with complex structures. There are more than 1,000 species of intestinal bacteria, and the number reaches approximately 1014. The ratio of bacterial number to human cell number ranged from 10:1 to 1:1. It also contains 100-fold more genes than our own genome, which is called the second genome of the human body. In terms of the types of intestinal bacteria, the gut microbiota is mainly composed of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, and this composition is relatively stable in healthy individuals but not in patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) or other diseases. Among those gut microbiota, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in the large intestine account for about 90% of the total number of gut microbiota, and the ratio is a vital health indicator reflecting the condition of health and is also associated with the incidence of CVDs.

"Aromatic amino acids including tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine are metabolized into indole and phenols by certain intestinal anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, and Peptostreptococcus. Tryptophan is decomposed into indole, indoleacetic acid, indole-3-lactic acid, 3-methylindole (skatole) and other indole compounds under the action of tryptophanase. Tryptophanase is the key enzyme that generates indole. The activity of the enzyme is easily induced by the substrate tryptophan, so when the amount of tryptophan changes in the colonic environment, the content of indole will fluctuate greatly. Of note, the metabolic products of aromatic amino acids generated by gut microbiota have a great impact on the pathology of cardiometabolic diseases. For example, indole propionic acid is associated with insulin sensitivity and appears to reduce the risk of diabetes. Moreover, the gut microbiota metabolizes dietary tryptophan to indoxyl, which further generates indoxyl sulfate through sulfonation. Excessive accumulation of indoxyl sulfate causes cardiomyocyte damage and increases thrombus formation.

"Previous results have indicated that the metabolic regulation of BAs may be associated with T2D but the specific changes in BAs and the related mechanisms remain to be studied. It is also unclear how the different types of BAs change in patients with T2D. A study also suggested that patients with T2D had no change in plasma total BAs, but had an increase in DCA and a decrease in CDCA in plasma. Another study found that the plasma total BA concentration in patients with T2D was not significantly different from that of healthy people; however, the concentration of DCA in the plasma of patients with T2D was significantly higher than that of healthy controls. The mechanism may be that FXR and TGR5 are inhibited during insulin resistance, and the most effective natural ligands of the receptors, DCA and CA, are compensatorily increased. Besides, circulating BAs levels including DCA, TCA, TDCA, and glycodeoxycholic acid, are positively associated with the risk of T2D, while taurohyodeoxycholic acid is negatively associated with diabetes. This may be due to the fact that hydrophobic BAs isoforms (such as DCA) have been shown to be involved in inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress with glucose dysregulation, and hydrophilic BAs isoforms (such as tauroursodeoxycholic acid) have been shown to prevent inflammation and enhance insulin sensitivity.",18340523.0,2039,2040,patients,237.0,245.0,Species,284.0,292.0,patients,Species,None
"Importantly, studies found that the occurrence of CVDs was also involved in the immune response mediated by the NLR family. For example, atherosclerotic plaques in LDLR-/- NOD 1/2-/- mice showed less lipid deposition and macrophage aggregation, suggesting that lack of NOD 1/2 may reduce the occurrence of atherosclerosis. Moreover, the peptidoglycan components in bacteria can bind to NOD1 and NOD2, which in turn mediate the occurrence of the inflammatory response, and further leads to atherosclerosis. Besides, inflammation induced by the NLRP3 inflammasome plays a role in the interaction between gut microbiota and cardiometabolic diseases. For instance, the NLRP3 deficient obese mice had altered composition of the gut microbiota, decreased TMAO and LPS levels, as well as downregulated hepatic steatosis and myocardial energy metabolism. Nevertheless, another study reported that NOD TLR4 -/- mice developed higher body weight, hyperlipidemia, severe insulin, and glucose intolerance, lower circulating SCFAs levels, higher levels of Bacteroidetes, lower levels of Firmicutes in the large intestine, as well as fewer SCFAs-associated gut microbiota, all of which may promote the development of insulin-deficient diabetes.",16855003.0,373,368,macrophage aggregation,221.0,243.0,Disease,200.0,205.0,lipid,Chemical,Location_of

"Mechanically, current studies suggest that SCFAs may exert their functions through acting as energy substrates and maintaining metabolic integration by a variety of different downstream regulatory mechanisms, such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPRs) with GPR41/Recombinant Free Fatty Acid Receptor (FFAR3), GPR43/FFAR2, GPR109A, Olfactory Receptors 78 (Olfr78) in endocrine cells of the gut wall, as well as histone deacetylases (HDACs) (Fig. 2). GPR41 regulates host energy acquisition and promotes the catabolism of glucose and lipids. The decreased SCFAs may cause less activated GPR41 and higher levels of energy uptake. In addition, it has also been reported that the lower production of SCFAs in gut microbiota would increase the host's capability of obtaining energy from the diet. SCFAs from bacterial fermentation promote the secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY) through GPR43 and GPR41 from intestinal L cells.

"The origins of Parkinson's disease are the result of many factors such as increased age, polygenic factors (disease-segregating mutations in alpha-synuclein protein occurring in 15% of PD patients), toxins, and infectious agents. In 2006, Braak et al. assumed the gut-related origins of Parkinson's disease. One of the key pathological hallmarks of PD is Lewy bodies, being eosinophilic inclusion forms of misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates. Importantly, alpha-synuclein protein has a tendency to misfold and form aggregates. Its accumulation has been detected during bacterial and viral infections in the gut. Moreover, it can be recognized as a characteristic indicator of PD neural degeneration. This protein aggregate can boost the local immune response. Interestingly, alpha-synuclein deposition has been confirmed in the neurons of the intestinal submucosa, together with a possibility of the alpha-synuclein transport to the brain via the vagus nerve (translocation of prion-like proteins).

Regarding this, there were increased levels of bile acids conjugated with taurine (taurodeoxycholic, taurolithocholic, and taurochenodeoxycholic acid) observed, which correlates with motor activity in PD. It is worth underlining the role of taurine as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Moreover, it is fabricated and secreted by neurons during stress conditions, e.g., mitochondrial dysfunctions, where taurine seems to increase the neuronal survival rate due to calcium influx regulation and the intensified antioxidant gene expression. In summary, taurine demonstrates an important role in proper brain function and development. Additionally, it contributes to the volume regulation of brain cells, and interferes with synaptic amino acid receptors.",16207850.0,1058,1059,taurine,644.0,651.0,Chemical,704.0,711.0,calcium,Chemical,Interacts_with

The gut microbiota of AD patients represented a diminished amount and incidence of bacteria producing butyrate and proinflammatory-acting bacterial taxa. Many studies revealed that the decreased levels of SCFAs can cause increased gut permeability together with altered gut pH levels, enabling the spread of opportunistic bacteria from Shigella and Escherichia species, elevated both in AD and PD.

"The PD microbiome has a diminished variety of bacterial taxonomic groups, especially the ones associated with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects and the increase of phyla, which has toxic effects. Predominantly, the reduction was observed in the Lachnospiraceae family, including Butyrivibrio, Pseudobutyrivibrio, Coprococcus, Blautia and SCFAs-producing Prevotellaceae. The increased amount of Enterobacteriaceae is linked to the severity of postural instability and walking difficulties. Moreover, the PD microbiome is characterised by increased Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium species and decreased amount of Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae. The overgrowth of Akkermansia spp. in PD patients may be strain-specific and can be related to immune-response alterations, decreased mucus thicknesses, and increased constipation. Faecalibacterium family is a crucial player producing SCFAs and anti-inflammatory metabolites, maintaining gut health. Faecalibacterium balance disturbances can lead to impaired gut-barrier function, increasing the risk of infection with enteric pathogens and boosting alpha-synuclein formation. Similarly, the Lachnospiraceae family can produce butyrate, important for the proper function of the gut epithelium. Decreased Lachnospiraceae quantity might aggravate gut inflammation, stimulate toxin production, and damage the integrity of the gut epithelial barrier. PD patients' intestinal microflora were characterised by a diminished abundance of Lachnospiraceae, which was positively correlated with PD progress, cognitive decline, and impaired motor functions. These microbiome's compositional changes correlate well with some metabolic switches. PD microbiota show reduced SCFAs production, decreased carbohydrate fermentation, and augmented proteolytic fermentation. Chen et al. demonstrated that the SCFA level was relevant to microbiota composition changes and the clinical severity of PD. The levels of SCFAs acetate, butyrate, and propionate in fecal samples of PD patients were significantly reduced, contrary to their elevated concentration in plasma. Rodent models of PD disease have shown a positive effect of SCFAs on behavior and PD symptoms. Butyrate, as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, exerts neuroprotective activity, reducing dopaminergic cell death, and motor impairment, and improving cognitive functions.

"Mechanically, current studies suggest that SCFAs may exert their functions through acting as energy substrates and maintaining metabolic integration by a variety of different downstream regulatory mechanisms, such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPRs) with GPR41/Recombinant Free Fatty Acid Receptor (FFAR3), GPR43/FFAR2, GPR109A, Olfactory Receptors 78 (Olfr78) in endocrine cells of the gut wall, as well as histone deacetylases (HDACs) (Fig. 2). GPR41 regulates host energy acquisition and promotes the catabolism of glucose and lipids. The decreased SCFAs may cause less activated GPR41 and higher levels of energy uptake. In addition, it has also been reported that the lower production of SCFAs in gut microbiota would increase the host's capability of obtaining energy from the diet. SCFAs from bacterial fermentation promote the secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY) through GPR43 and GPR41 from intestinal L cells. GLP-1 increased pancreatic insulin secretion, and inhibited the production of glucagon. Deletion of GLP-1 abolished the beneficial effects of prebiotics on weight gain, glucose metabolism, and inflammatory pathway activation.

"The mechanism by which BCAAs induce insulin resistance is still not fully understood. The rise of BCAA levels is found to regulate glycolipid metabolism, cause insulin resistance, and increase the risk of T2D. Other animal experiments have shown that elevated BCAAs are transferred to skeletal muscle, and are interfered with lipid metabolism, which causes the accumulation of lipid metabolites and ultimately leads to skeletal muscle insulin resistance. Additionally, BCAAs are the key regulatory factor of mTORC1. It activates mTORC1 and ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (S6K1) by inducing the phosphorylation of IRS1, blocking the insulin signaling pathway, and eventually causing insulin resistance. However, 2 other studies have shown that BCAAs may exert their functions without mTORC1. One study reported that the metabolites of BCAAs, 3-hydroxy isobutyrate, could cause insulin resistance by promoting skeletal muscle sprouting. Another study reported that a diet rich in BCAAs can cause overeating, obesity, and shortened lifespan, which was not related to the mTOR signaling pathway in the liver but is mainly due to hyperphagia.",18449544.0,2344,2345,BCAA,98.0,102.0,Chemical,131.0,141.0,glycolipid,Chemical,decrease

"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal health condition caused by the progressive neural death of the spinal cord, brain stem, and motor cortex neurons, causing advanced weakness, paralysis, eating difficulties, and respiratory failure. One of the main signs of ALS is the accumulation of phosphorylated protein, which binds to DNA in the form of protein aggregates deposited in glia and motor neurons. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) methods, such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing, have demonstrated the alteration of numerous bacteria, including Parabacteroides distasonis, Lactobacillus gasseri, Prevotella melaninogenica, Ruminococcus torques, and Akkermansia muciniphila. Changes in bacterial abundance and diversity correlate with ASL origins (as one of the environmental factors) together with impaired metabolism, immunological functions, and toxin accumulation, leading to brain damage. It has been demonstrated that Akkermansia muciniphila alleviates ALS symptoms, although Ruminococcus torques and Parabacteroides distasonis aggravate them.

"Importantly, studies found that the occurrence of CVDs was also involved in the immune response mediated by the NLR family. For example, atherosclerotic plaques in LDLR-/- NOD 1/2-/- mice showed less lipid deposition and macrophage aggregation, suggesting that lack of NOD 1/2 may reduce the occurrence of atherosclerosis. Moreover, the peptidoglycan components in bacteria can bind to NOD1 and NOD2, which in turn mediate the occurrence of the inflammatory response, and further leads to atherosclerosis. Besides, inflammation induced by the NLRP3 inflammasome plays a role in the interaction between gut microbiota and cardiometabolic diseases. For instance, the NLRP3 deficient obese mice had altered composition of the gut microbiota, decreased TMAO and LPS levels, as well as downregulated hepatic steatosis and myocardial energy metabolism. Nevertheless, another study reported that NOD TLR4 -/- mice developed higher body weight, hyperlipidemia, severe insulin, and glucose intolerance, lower circulating SCFAs levels, higher levels of Bacteroidetes, lower levels of Firmicutes in the large intestine, as well as fewer SCFAs-associated gut microbiota, all of which may promote the development of insulin-deficient diabetes.",16855003.0,kif1r6lvZq,OZAHdydKPX,NOD TLR4,889.0,897.0,Gene,973.0,992.0,glucose intolerance,Disease,Negative_correlation
"SCFAs may prevent obesity by regulating the homeostasis of glucose and lipid metabolism. For instance, acetate decreases appetite and nutrient intake. Propionate activates intestinal gluconeogenesis by a gut-brain neural circuit to promote energy balance. Butyrate provides energy for colon cells, maintains the integrity of intestinal walls, and improves the insulin response, which activates gluconeogenesis to maintain the balance of glucose and energy through the cAMP pathway. And one study indicated that oral butyrate intake prevents obesity and insulin resistance. Furthermore, the role of SCFAs in metabolic hemostasis is related to other factors. Adenosine monophosphate activating protein (AMPK) is a heterotrimeric enzyme that stimulates liver and muscle fatty acid oxidation pathways. SCFAs promote the activity of AMPK and improve its ability to oxidize fatty acids. Last, SCFAs can affect the development of dyslipidemia. SCFAs increase the expression of fasting-induced adipose factor (FIAF), a circulating lipoprotein lipase inhibitor, by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-gamma), thereby decreasing the activity of lipoproteinases and inhibiting lipolysis in adipose tissues.

"Recent evidence has demonstrated the importance of the gut microbiota in the formation and development of the immune system. The gut microbiota has profound effects on the formation of lymphoid tissue and the development of the immune system. It stimulates the development of intestinal-associated lymphoid tissues, activates lymphocytes, and regulates the production of immunoglobulin A to defend against pathogens. The structural components of gut microbiota such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), flagella, and peptidoglycan, can interact with receptors on human cells to stimulate and guide the host immune response. For instance, LPS binds to Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, flagella binds to TLR5, and peptidoglycan binds to TLR2, triggering the expression of a large number of downstream inflammatory factors, thereby affecting the cardiovascular system.

"The function of the gut microbiota is closely related to the risk of CVDs. Specifically, an impaired mucosal barrier, overactivated inflammation, and immune dysfunction are crucial steps in the development of CVDs triggered by gut microbiota dysbiosis. The structural constituents of gram-negative bacteria, such as LPS, are the main reason for endotoxemia and impaired intestinal mucosal barrier function. It has been reported that LPS is important in the development of cardiometabolic diseases. Moreover, studies showed that the high-fat diet could result in decreased intestinal levels of gram-positive Bifidobacteria and increased LPS-containing gut microbiota which further leads to obesity, the main risk factor for CVDs. Importantly, continuous subcutaneous infusion of LPS showed a tendency to cause the change of glucose metabolism and the pattern of weight gain was similar to that seen when taking a high-fat diet. Therefore, intestinal dysbiosis and the corresponding change in metabolites lead to abnormal nutrient metabolism, insulin resistance, and increased adipose tissue storage, which increases the risk of cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity and diabetes.

In these patients, increased inflammation was probably related to Eubacterium deficiency, and an overabundance of gram-negative Escherichia and Shigella species, which are known amyloid producers. They manufacture ""curli"" amyloid fibers, accumulated extracellularly through an elaborated system. Further studies revealed that the overproduction of Abeta plaques is correlated with excessive growth of Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycobacterium and Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus spp.. Galloway et al. found Abeta in small intestine epithelial cells, suggesting that gut-derived amyloids could be absorbed and finally reach systemic circulation, where they can act as pro-inflammatory factors and trigger fibrillogenesis. Additionally, it was shown that amyloids generated by microbes can influence IL-17A and IL-22 proinflammatory cytokines production, considered as a key players in NFkappaB signaling, both associated with AD and capable of crossing the BBB and GI tract.",16171393.0,991bXEtCC_,715,GI tract,1334.0,1342.0,Cellline,1254.0,1262.0,NFkappaB,Species,Location_of
"The origins of Parkinson's disease are the result of many factors such as increased age, polygenic factors (disease-segregating mutations in alpha-synuclein protein occurring in 15% of PD patients), toxins, and infectious agents. In 2006, Braak et al. assumed the gut-related origins of Parkinson's disease. One of the key pathological hallmarks of PD is Lewy bodies, being eosinophilic inclusion forms of misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates. Importantly, alpha-synuclein protein has a tendency to misfold and form aggregates. Its accumulation has been detected during bacterial and viral infections in the gut. Moreover, it can be recognized as a characteristic indicator of PD neural degeneration. This protein aggregate can boost the local immune response. Interestingly, alpha-synuclein deposition has been confirmed in the neurons of the intestinal submucosa, together with a possibility of the alpha-synuclein transport to the brain via the vagus nerve (translocation of prion-like proteins). Misfolded alpha-synuclein triggers neuronal dysfunction and progressive degeneration, thereby enabling disease progression. Additionally, alpha-synuclein deposition in CNS is associated with intestinal hyperpermeability, TLRs, and pro-inflammatory cytokine overexpression.

"Importantly, studies found that the occurrence of CVDs was also involved in the immune response mediated by the NLR family. For example, atherosclerotic plaques in LDLR-/- NOD 1/2-/- mice showed less lipid deposition and macrophage aggregation, suggesting that lack of NOD 1/2 may reduce the occurrence of atherosclerosis. Moreover, the peptidoglycan components in bacteria can bind to NOD1 and NOD2, which in turn mediate the occurrence of the inflammatory response, and further leads to atherosclerosis. Besides, inflammation induced by the NLRP3 inflammasome plays a role in the interaction between gut microbiota and cardiometabolic diseases. For instance, the NLRP3 deficient obese mice had altered composition of the gut microbiota, decreased TMAO and LPS levels, as well as downregulated hepatic steatosis and myocardial energy metabolism. Nevertheless, another study reported that NOD TLR4 -/- mice developed higher body weight, hyperlipidemia, severe insulin, and glucose intolerance, lower circulating SCFAs levels, higher levels of Bacteroidetes, lower levels of Firmicutes in the large intestine, as well as fewer SCFAs-associated gut microbiota, all of which may promote the development of insulin-deficient diabetes.",16855003.0,389,375,NOD2,395.0,399.0,Gene,489.0,504.0,atherosclerosis,Disease,start

"Additionally, it has been reported that the intestinal microbiota plays a very crucial role in the neuroendocrine system, which is correlated to the gut-brain axis. As the major neuroendocrine system, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulates various pathophysiological processes in response to inside and outside stressors. It is increasingly recognized that the establishment of intestinal microbiota in early life can impact the development as well as the function of nervous system, especially regulating neuroendocrine function. In neonatal germ-free mice, colonization with B. infantis, and Bifidobacterium could attenuate the high sensitivity of the HPA axis and establish functional neural circuits. The imbalanced microbiota may fail to execute metabolic functions, brain function and neuromodulators. The regulation of neurohumoral-immune not only promotes the development of neurological diseases, but also promotes the occurrence and development of CVDs via the HPA axis and renin-angiotensin system (RAS). For example, dysregulation of the gut-brain axis was associated with hypertension. Interestingly, the gut microbiota can be called ""an endocrine organ"" that biologically regulates host metabolism, for affecting the host's endocrine system by altering the functional metabolism of important hormones such as leptin, ghrelin and cortisol.

"Trillions of microorganisms colonize the anaerobic and nutritious environment in the gut to form a healthy intestinal physiological ecosystem. These communities are regarded as ""gut microbiota"", and the sum total of all microorganism genomes in the gut, including their DNA sequences and other genetic information, are together called ""gut microbiomes"". Most intestinal microbial communities in the human intestinal tract are bacteria with complex structures. There are more than 1,000 species of intestinal bacteria, and the number reaches approximately 1014. The ratio of bacterial number to human cell number ranged from 10:1 to 1:1. It also contains 100-fold more genes than our own genome, which is called the second genome of the human body. In terms of the types of intestinal bacteria, the gut microbiota is mainly composed of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, and this composition is relatively stable in healthy individuals but not in patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) or other diseases. Among those gut microbiota, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in the large intestine account for about 90% of the total number of gut microbiota, and the ratio is a vital health indicator reflecting the condition of health and is also associated with the incidence of CVDs.

"In the past decade, single dietary factors which can positively manipulate the gut microbiota-brain axis through microbiome modulation have gained significant attention. One of these factors is probiotic bacteria and/or prebiotics. Probiotics are defined as microbial organisms with a beneficial role in the host's health and homeostasis, which help to preserve digestive, metabolic, immune, and neuroendocrine functions. Naturally probiotic bacteria can be found in fermented food. Experimental results revealed that the administration of probiotics alone or in combination with prebiotics (fructooligosaccharides or galactooligosaccharides) improved the gastrointestinal barrier, which is the first line of ""defence"" from harmful factors occurring in food, and the microbiome. Probiotics and prebiotics are well-documented ""problem-solution"" for gastrointestinal diseases. Moreover, probiotics can reduce CNS inflammatory processes and activation of microglia, demonstrating promising potential for use in neurodegenerative diseases as ingestible ""psychobiotics"". Many studies indicate that the ingestion of probiotics can serve as a microbiological strategy against neurodegenerative diseases such as AD; however, the exact mechanism is under investigation. Experiments performed on mice underline the hypothesis that mechanisms related to neuroprotective effects of Bifidobacterium breve administration may be connected with neuroinflammation and cognition pathways, probably through the production of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) neurotransmitter and the regulation of the gut microbial composition. Clinical results of a randomized double-blind controlled trial revealed that 3-month exposure to Lactobacillus spp. And a Bifidobacterium bifidum ""cocktail"" enhanced cognitive functions and memory, as examined in a mini-mental state test. It was demonstrated that Bifidobacterium breve exerts positive and unique activity in AD patients, improving cognitive functions and reducing neuroinflammation.

"Contrarily, as a positive example, balanced diets (i.e., Mediterranean diet and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) can be mentioned. Diets abundant in natural compounds with anti-inflammatory activity, antioxidants, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and plant-origin nutrients (proteins, polyphenols, vitamins, and fibers), together with reduced caloric intake, such as the Mediterranean diet, are correlated with a lower risk of dementia, decrease age-related cognitive deterioration, and the risk of neurodegeneration occurrence. Moreover, the Mediterranean diet increases the amount of gut Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus and reduces malignant bacteria belonging to Clostridium and Bacteroides, thereby improving memory and cognitive processes in healthy females after menopause and disorder patients. Additionally, following such a diet significantly reduces amyloid aggregation and therefore the frequency of amyloid-related diseases in the aging population.

"It is currently controversial whether supplementation with BCAAs would increase circulating BCAAs, thereby increasing the risk of diabetes. And reducing BCAAs intake promotes fat mass loss and insulin sensitivity in mice with obesity. A high BCAAs diet causes excessive feeding, mainly due to excessive appetite. Adding threonine to balance the composition of amino acids in the diet can inhibit food intake. Nevertheless, some studies have found that supplementary BCAAs, such as isoleucine and leucine, can improve insulin resistance and reduce weight to lower the risk of obesity and diabetes. The inconsistency may be due to the individual state of energy excess or energy deficiency. In terms of an excessive energy state, such as in patients with obesity or diabetes who have an impaired ability to degrade BCAAs, BCAAs and related metabolites accumulate in circulation to reduce insulin sensitivity and cause insulin resistance. In most elderly people with inadequate energy or athletes who maintain good fitness habits, BCAAs can improve the form of metabolism. In these people, BCAAs decomposition metabolism is increased by regulatory factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha coactivator (PGC-1alpha) and PPARalpha, so that BCAAs levels are maintained in a steady state, which ultimately promotes glucose intake and insulin sensitivity. This was supported by the study of Newgard, who pointed out that dietary intake of BCAAs might interact with a high-fat diet to induce abnormal metabolic phenotypes such as insulin resistance. Mice fed BCAAs alone did not develop insulin resistance. However, when mice were fed a high-fat diet supplemented with BCAAs, they developed insulin resistance. This study suggested that BCAAs only lead to insulin resistance in the presence of excess energy intake. Therefore, more studies are needed to explore the supplementation with BCAAs and insulin resistance as well as the development of cardiovascular risk factors.",19341206.0,2468,2469,energy excess or energy deficiency,653.0,687.0,Disease,753.0,760.0,obesity,Disease,None

"The gut microbiota is critical to human health, such as digesting nutrients, forming the intestinal epithelial barrier, regulating immune function, producing vitamins and hormones, and producing metabolites to interact with the host. Meanwhile, increasing evidence indicates that the gut microbiota has a strong correlation with the occurrence, progression and treatment of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). In patients with CVDs and corresponding risk factors, the composition and ratio of gut microbiota have significant differences compared with their healthy counterparts. Therefore, gut microbiota dysbiosis, gut microbiota-generated metabolites, and the related signaling pathway may serve as explanations for some of the mechanisms about the occurrence and development of CVDs. Several studies have also demonstrated that many traditional and latest therapeutic treatments of CVDs are associated with the gut microbiota and its generated metabolites and related signaling pathways. Given that information, we summarized the latest advances in the current research regarding the effect of gut microbiota on health, the main cardiovascular risk factors, and CVDs, highlighted the roles and mechanisms of several metabolites, and introduced corresponding promising treatments for CVDs regarding the gut microbiota.

The increased BCAAs-induced insulin resistance was associated with the presence of Prevotella copri and Bacteroides vulgatus. The major groups of gut bacteria that biosynthesize BCAAs are Prevotella copri and Bacteroides vulgatus, and the insulin resistance caused by elevated BCAAs levels is associated with the presence of these two bacteria.

"The PD microbiome has a diminished variety of bacterial taxonomic groups, especially the ones associated with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects and the increase of phyla, which has toxic effects. Predominantly, the reduction was observed in the Lachnospiraceae family, including Butyrivibrio, Pseudobutyrivibrio, Coprococcus, Blautia and SCFAs-producing Prevotellaceae. The increased amount of Enterobacteriaceae is linked to the severity of postural instability and walking difficulties. Moreover, the PD microbiome is characterised by increased Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium species and decreased amount of Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae. The overgrowth of Akkermansia spp. in PD patients may be strain-specific and can be related to immune-response alterations, decreased mucus thicknesses, and increased constipation. Faecalibacterium family is a crucial player producing SCFAs and anti-inflammatory metabolites, maintaining gut health. Faecalibacterium balance disturbances can lead to impaired gut-barrier function, increasing the risk of infection with enteric pathogens and boosting alpha-synuclein formation. Similarly, the Lachnospiraceae family can produce butyrate, important for the proper function of the gut epithelium. Decreased Lachnospiraceae quantity might aggravate gut inflammation, stimulate toxin production, and damage the integrity of the gut epithelial barrier. PD patients' intestinal microflora were characterised by a diminished abundance of Lachnospiraceae, which was positively correlated with PD progress, cognitive decline, and impaired motor functions. These microbiome's compositional changes correlate well with some metabolic switches. PD microbiota show reduced SCFAs production, decreased carbohydrate fermentation, and augmented proteolytic fermentation. Chen et al. demonstrated that the SCFA level was relevant to microbiota composition changes and the clinical severity of PD. The levels of SCFAs acetate, butyrate, and propionate in fecal samples of PD patients were significantly reduced, contrary to their elevated concentration in plasma. Rodent models of PD disease have shown a positive effect of SCFAs on behavior and PD symptoms. Butyrate, as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, exerts neuroprotective activity, reducing dopaminergic cell death, and motor impairment, and improving cognitive functions. Taken together, SCFAs play an important role in protection from PD disease and could be proposed as representative gut-oriented indicators for diversifying individuals with PD and placing disease progression.",16553034.0,boYJt-klFi,7fcykAguDK,immune-response alterations,756.0,783.0,Disease,679.0,695.0,Akkermansia spp.,Species,increase
"Experimental research confirms the hypothesis regarding SCFA reduction in autoimmune diseases (MS among others) and altered gut microbiota. A low level of SCFAs dysregulates Treg cell functions, leading to insufficient immune tolerance towards endogenous components and enteric microbiota. However, this process can be reversed by SCFAs supplementation (e.g., propionic acid). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing NFkappaB activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation and on microglial cells in vitro. TUDCA binds to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) expressed in microglial cells. This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS). Experimental results demonstrated that TUDCA acted as a double-edged sword, triggering microglia enhancement in anti-inflammatory and alternatively activated markers and on the other hand reducing the infiltration of macrophages and microglia with expressed pro-inflammatory markers. Interestingly, during neuroinflammation, microglial cells change their morphology, converting themselves into reactive macrophage-like forms. However, microglial cells are flexible, as they can sometimes polarize towards alternatively activated phenotypes, promoting CNS pathologies (proinflammatory or M1 microglia), or exert anti-inflammatory effects, boosting cell repair and remodeling. Bile acids were identified as nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor agonists, leading to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) depletion (in a mouse model) and neuroinflammatory process adjustment.

"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal health condition caused by the progressive neural death of the spinal cord, brain stem, and motor cortex neurons, causing advanced weakness, paralysis, eating difficulties, and respiratory failure.

"Aromatic amino acids including tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine are metabolized into indole and phenols by certain intestinal anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, and Peptostreptococcus. Tryptophan is decomposed into indole, indoleacetic acid, indole-3-lactic acid, 3-methylindole (skatole) and other indole compounds under the action of tryptophanase. Tryptophanase is the key enzyme that generates indole. The activity of the enzyme is easily induced by the substrate tryptophan, so when the amount of tryptophan changes in the colonic environment, the content of indole will fluctuate greatly. Of note, the metabolic products of aromatic amino acids generated by gut microbiota have a great impact on the pathology of cardiometabolic diseases. For example, indole propionic acid is associated with insulin sensitivity and appears to reduce the risk of diabetes. Moreover, the gut microbiota metabolizes dietary tryptophan to indoxyl, which further generates indoxyl sulfate through sulfonation. Excessive accumulation of indoxyl sulfate causes cardiomyocyte damage and increases thrombus formation. Another phenol compound, 4-methylphenol, can inhibit the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into mature adipocytes, induce apoptosis and reduce glucose uptake.

"Trillions of microorganisms colonize the anaerobic and nutritious environment in the gut to form a healthy intestinal physiological ecosystem. These communities are regarded as ""gut microbiota"", and the sum total of all microorganism genomes in the gut, including their DNA sequences and other genetic information, are together called ""gut microbiomes"". Most intestinal microbial communities in the human intestinal tract are bacteria with complex structures. There are more than 1,000 species of intestinal bacteria, and the number reaches approximately 1014. The ratio of bacterial number to human cell number ranged from 10:1 to 1:1.

"The function of the gut microbiota is closely related to the risk of CVDs. Specifically, an impaired mucosal barrier, overactivated inflammation, and immune dysfunction are crucial steps in the development of CVDs triggered by gut microbiota dysbiosis. The structural constituents of gram-negative bacteria, such as LPS, are the main reason for endotoxemia and impaired intestinal mucosal barrier function. It has been reported that LPS is important in the development of cardiometabolic diseases. Moreover, studies showed that the high-fat diet could result in decreased intestinal levels of gram-positive Bifidobacteria and increased LPS-containing gut microbiota which further leads to obesity, the main risk factor for CVDs. Importantly, continuous subcutaneous infusion of LPS showed a tendency to cause the change of glucose metabolism and the pattern of weight gain was similar to that seen when taking a high-fat diet. Therefore, intestinal dysbiosis and the corresponding change in metabolites lead to abnormal nutrient metabolism, insulin resistance, and increased adipose tissue storage, which increases the risk of cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity and diabetes.

"At the end of this chapter, it is worth mentioning the fact that the interaction between the microbiome and the host is bidirectional, and some metabolic changes, which could be a pathological result of disease progression, also influence microbiome metabolism. A good example is a disturbance in cholesterol homeostasis, which correlates with an augmented probability of Alzheimer's disease occurrence. In addition, alteration of the intestinal microbiota composition with the subsequent fluctuations in the serum and brain levels of bile acids (BAs) is involved in the development of AD. BAs can act as detergents, affecting BBB permeability, and incrementing brain influx of peripheral cholesterol and BAs. Therefore, proper cholesterol elimination pathways play a crucial role in AD prevention and treatment. The gut microbiome is a main ""organ"" metabolizing secondary bile acids. Peripheral cholesterol is eliminated mainly through its liver conversion to BAs. The gut microbiota performs BA transformation via deconjugation and dehydroxylation, leading to secondary BA formation. Nho et al. investigated the correlation between neurodegeneration and BAs, B-amyloid, and tau protein concentration. The application of targeted metabolomics enabled the determination of the association between intestinal microbiota-derived secondary bile acids and sera BAs. Interestingly, the analysis indicated an imbalanced BA ratio, underlying an increased amount of secondary BAs over primary ones. Another clinical study confirmed the correlation between bile acid metabolic profile and the prevalence of AD and mild cognitive impairment, showing similar BA ratio disruptions. Decreased cognitive functions were positively associated with increased concentrations of secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid, and glycolithocholic acid.

"It remains unclear how the gut microbiota and BAs profiles interact with each other and whether the interaction is associated with obesity. Mice fed BAs exhibited obesity and a composition change in the obesity-associated gut microbiota, which is similar to high-fat diet-fed mice. Under a high-fat diet, the concentration of intestinal BAs increases, and the composition of gut microbiota alternates. For example, the increased BAs are the main reason for the marked increase in the abundance of the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. Another study has shown that BAs and a high-fat diet promote the growth of Bilophila wadsworthia in mice, and secondary BAs produced by Bilophila spp. have been shown to induce obesity. What's more, it has been reported that the low capacity of microbiota to metabolize Tauro-beta-muricholic acid, a primary BA, might increase the risk of obesity and insulin resistance.

"Scientific evidence indicates that the metabolic status of microbiota exerts a more important role than the equilibrium between bacterial species. Microbial metabolites can act as positive modulators of the gut-brain-axis constituents, boosting the immune cells and exerting a positive/protective effect on neurodegenerative disease progression. On the other hand, disrupted equilibrium between microbial species often leads to specific switches in the microbial metabolome, which may be harmful and associated with neurodegenerative disease progression. For example, dysregulation of Gram-negative bacteria in the gastrointestinal area leads to the production of harmful metabolites (i.e., endo- and exotoxins, saccharides, and amyloids). Exotoxins, such as LPS, which have the ability to activate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, exert negative effects. LPS belongs to glycolipid molecules, mostly produced by Gram-negative bacterial strains. These molecules participate in the integrity maintenance of the bacterial outer-membrane permeability barrier, playing an important role in host-pathogen interplay. The overproduction of bacterial LPS can cause the activation of the macrophage-monocyte nod-like receptor P3 inflammasome, therefore stimulating the production of cytokines with pro-inflammatory activity, such as IL-18 or IL-1beta. LPS can be translocated and intensify neuroinflammatory diseases such as AD. Additionally, it was demonstrated that IL-1beta can decrease the phagocytic function of microglial cells, stimulating the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, and causing reduced synaptic plasticity and cognitive deterioration.

"In summary, the gut microbiota generates a series of bioactive metabolites to interact with host metabolism. These metabolites mainly include SCFAs, primary and secondary BAs, TMAO, and so on. Among these metabolites, some exert synergistic effects to promote host health by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system to control glucose metabolism. For example, SCFAs interact with human hormones such as GLP-1 and PYY to effect energy uptake and the development of obesity. SCFAs are beneficial for regulating appetite and energy intake, and preventing the formation of atherosclerosis. Other metabolites, such as TMAO and phenylacetylglutamine (PAGln), may be toxic. For example, TMAO may be proatherogenic to promote the process of thrombosis and atherosclerosis, thereby increasing the risk of cardiovascular events. Patients with CVDs had lower levels of SCFA generation and higher levels of TMAO production due to the change in gut microbiota. Furthermore, TMAO causes vascular endothelial damage and promotes the production of atherosclerotic plaques. TMAO can also increase the release of intracellular calcium ions, enhance the reactivity of platelets, and increase the risk of thrombosis to increase CVDs susceptibility.

"Experimental research confirms the hypothesis regarding SCFA reduction in autoimmune diseases (MS among others) and altered gut microbiota. A low level of SCFAs dysregulates Treg cell functions, leading to insufficient immune tolerance towards endogenous components and enteric microbiota. However, this process can be reversed by SCFAs supplementation (e.g., propionic acid). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing NFkappaB activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation and on microglial cells in vitro. TUDCA binds to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) expressed in microglial cells. This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS). Experimental results demonstrated that TUDCA acted as a double-edged sword, triggering microglia enhancement in anti-inflammatory and alternatively activated markers and on the other hand reducing the infiltration of macrophages and microglia with expressed pro-inflammatory markers. Interestingly, during neuroinflammation, microglial cells change their morphology, converting themselves into reactive macrophage-like forms. However, microglial cells are flexible, as they can sometimes polarize towards alternatively activated phenotypes, promoting CNS pathologies (proinflammatory or M1 microglia), or exert anti-inflammatory effects, boosting cell repair and remodeling. Bile acids were identified as nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor agonists, leading to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) depletion (in a mouse model) and neuroinflammatory process adjustment. The administration of the complex probiotic positively influenced the intestinal flora balance in patients diagnosed with MS.

"SCFAs may prevent obesity by regulating the homeostasis of glucose and lipid metabolism. For instance, acetate decreases appetite and nutrient intake.

And one study indicated that oral butyrate intake prevents obesity and insulin resistance. Furthermore, the role of SCFAs in metabolic hemostasis is related to other factors. Adenosine monophosphate activating protein (AMPK) is a heterotrimeric enzyme that stimulates liver and muscle fatty acid oxidation pathways. SCFAs promote the activity of AMPK and improve its ability to oxidize fatty acids. Last, SCFAs can affect the development of dyslipidemia. SCFAs increase the expression of fasting-induced adipose factor (FIAF), a circulating lipoprotein lipase inhibitor, by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-gamma), thereby decreasing the activity of lipoproteinases and inhibiting lipolysis in adipose tissues.

Several interventions targeting gut microbiota, such as SCFAs supplementation and microbiota transplantation, have shown beneficial therapeutic efficacy for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.

"Scientific evidence indicates that the metabolic status of microbiota exerts a more important role than the equilibrium between bacterial species. Microbial metabolites can act as positive modulators of the gut-brain-axis constituents, boosting the immune cells and exerting a positive/protective effect on neurodegenerative disease progression. On the other hand, disrupted equilibrium between microbial species often leads to specific switches in the microbial metabolome, which may be harmful and associated with neurodegenerative disease progression. For example, dysregulation of Gram-negative bacteria in the gastrointestinal area leads to the production of harmful metabolites (i.e., endo- and exotoxins, saccharides, and amyloids). Exotoxins, such as LPS, which have the ability to activate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, exert negative effects. LPS belongs to glycolipid molecules, mostly produced by Gram-negative bacterial strains. These molecules participate in the integrity maintenance of the bacterial outer-membrane permeability barrier, playing an important role in host-pathogen interplay. The overproduction of bacterial LPS can cause the activation of the macrophage-monocyte nod-like receptor P3 inflammasome, therefore stimulating the production of cytokines with pro-inflammatory activity, such as IL-18 or IL-1beta. LPS can be translocated and intensify neuroinflammatory diseases such as AD. Additionally, it was demonstrated that IL-1beta can decrease the phagocytic function of microglial cells, stimulating the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, and causing reduced synaptic plasticity and cognitive deterioration.

"The bacteria living in the human gut are also called commensals. Some beneficial commensal microbes could repair the normal function of the intestinal barrier and exert anti-inflammatory effects, such as Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila), Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Roseburia intestinalis, et al. . These commensal microbes make up about 20% of the total gut microbiota. They are indispensable for maintaining the physiological function of adult tissues and organs by synthesizing a variety of vitamins, participating in food digestion, producing lactic acid, promoting intestinal peristalsis, inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microbiota, and activating the immune system. For example, one of the most important commensal microbes in the human gut is Bifidobacterium, a strictly anaerobic gram-positive bacterium, which assists the human body in the digestion and absorption of nutrients, resists the invasion of harmful bacteria, improves the immune function of the body, secretes molecules to regulate immune function, and participates in the metabolism of substances in the intestine. Besides, another common commensal microbe, A. muciniphila, a gram-positive bacterium, reduces insulin sensitivity and is inversely associated with the development of obesity and diabetes.

"Besides the propagation of an inflammatory state, microbial endotoxins are probably involved in AD's inflammatory amyloidosis. Metagenomics analysis showed that patients suffering from cognitive dysfunctions related to amyloidosis demonstrated elevated amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neurotoxic compounds.

The rise of BCAA levels is found to regulate glycolipid metabolism, cause insulin resistance, and increase the risk of T2D.

Additionally, BCAAs are the key regulatory factor of mTORC1. It activates mTORC1 and ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (S6K1) by inducing the phosphorylation of IRS1, blocking the insulin signaling pathway, and eventually causing insulin resistance. However, 2 other studies have shown that BCAAs may exert their functions without mTORC1.

"In fact, changes in the function of gut microecology and gut microbiota may cause the occurrence and exacerbation of various diseases.

The gut microbiota has been reported to be associated with CVDs and its corresponding risk factors, such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, and insulin resistance.

"Recently, bacterial strains producing SCFAs have gained extreme popularity. SCFAs are small organic monocarboxylic acids, released after the fermentation of indigestible alimentary fiber (mainly galacto- or fructooligosaccharides), plant-derived polysaccharides, or the metabolism of amino acids, and are considered a key gut-derived metabolites with beneficial health effects and as essential in gut-brain crosstalk. The type of formed SCFAs is correlated with the kind of fiber ingested and the overall gut microbiota population. For example, microbes belonging to Firmicutes phyla (e.g., Lachnospiraceae, Eubacterium, or Roseburia belonging to the Clostridia class) are responsible for the main production of butyrate, whereas Bifidobacteria spp. produce lactate and acetate. SCFAs are significantly reduced during dysbiosis, where disrupted gut epithelial integrity, inflammation, and altered microbiome metabolic processes occur. In a healthy colon, levels of SCFAs can vary depending on a diet; however, in multiple diseases, these levels are altered. SCFAs may also act in an indirect or direct way through G-protein-coupled receptors or as histone deacetylase epigenetic modulators. They participate in various physiological processes, such as cell energetics and colonocyte metabolism and skeletal, adipose, and liver tissue modulation.

"SCFAs may prevent obesity by regulating the homeostasis of glucose and lipid metabolism. For instance, acetate decreases appetite and nutrient intake. Propionate activates intestinal gluconeogenesis by a gut-brain neural circuit to promote energy balance. Butyrate provides energy for colon cells, maintains the integrity of intestinal walls, and improves the insulin response, which activates gluconeogenesis to maintain the balance of glucose and energy through the cAMP pathway. And one study indicated that oral butyrate intake prevents obesity and insulin resistance. Furthermore, the role of SCFAs in metabolic hemostasis is related to other factors. Adenosine monophosphate activating protein (AMPK) is a heterotrimeric enzyme that stimulates liver and muscle fatty acid oxidation pathways. SCFAs promote the activity of AMPK and improve its ability to oxidize fatty acids. Last, SCFAs can affect the development of dyslipidemia. SCFAs increase the expression of fasting-induced adipose factor (FIAF), a circulating lipoprotein lipase inhibitor, by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-gamma), thereby decreasing the activity of lipoproteinases and inhibiting lipolysis in adipose tissues.

"BAs, as by-products of cholesterol metabolism, are the main organic component of bile and are synthesized in hepatocytes. Cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) are primary BAs directly synthesized from cholesterol; secondary BAs include deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholic acid (LCA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and their glycine and taurine conjugated forms. BAs are excreted into the intestine to aid in the digestion and absorption of lipids and combine with farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and takeda-G-protein receptor 5 (TGR5) (Fig. 2). There is a strong biochemical relationship between BAs and gut microbiota. Some gut microbiota in healthy people can convert conjugated BAs into free BAs, and can transform BAs into secondary BAs with the help of bile salt hydrolase (BSH) and cholesterol 7-alpha hydroxy-lase (CYP7A1), so as to reduce blood cholesterol by affecting the enterohepatic circulation of BAs. Besides, the gut microbiota affects the metabolism of BAs by regulating the activity of BSH to reduce LDL cholesterol levels. BAs have bacteriostatic properties and an antimicrobial effect. BAs destroy the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane and thereby change the intestinal microecology. BAs also prevent bacteria from overgrowth and decrease inflammation. More importantly, BAs are also closely associated with CVDs. For example, BAs levels in the feces of patients with CVDs are different from those in healthy individuals.

"Importantly, studies found that the occurrence of CVDs was also involved in the immune response mediated by the NLR family. For example, atherosclerotic plaques in LDLR-/- NOD 1/2-/- mice showed less lipid deposition and macrophage aggregation, suggesting that lack of NOD 1/2 may reduce the occurrence of atherosclerosis. Moreover, the peptidoglycan components in bacteria can bind to NOD1 and NOD2, which in turn mediate the occurrence of the inflammatory response, and further leads to atherosclerosis. Besides, inflammation induced by the NLRP3 inflammasome plays a role in the interaction between gut microbiota and cardiometabolic diseases.

Previous studies showed that the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota could lead to the rapid proliferation of intestinal pathogenic bacteria, and the pro-inflammatory factors released by them seriously damaged the structure and function of the intestinal barrier, and it also promoted the occurrence and development of diseases in the digestive system as well as metabolic system. Furthermore, the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota triggers intestinal mucosal barrier damage, leading to inflammation and disordered nutrient metabolism. Overactivated inflammation caused by microbiota dysbiosis disrupts normal intestinal mucosal barrier function, and increases intestinal permeability to promote bacterial translocation, leading to endotoxemia and inflammation, thereby increasing the risk of CVDs.",16622110.0,748Loro7i2,SRvmW0PyAa,microbiota dysbiosis,715.0,735.0,Disease,803.0,826.0,intestinal permeability,Disease,causes

"Insufficient dietary fiber intake is considered to be an important risk factor for diabetes. The decrease in the production of SCFAs counts for an important reason here. Modulation of dietary SCFAs is thought to reshape the gut microbiota in diabetes and ameliorate diabetes. SCFAs increase fatty acid oxidation and energy expenditure to decrease the risk of suffering from T2D. Of note, T2D patients have lower levels of butyrate-generating bacteria. Butyrate could promote the secretion of postprandial insulin; and the increase in fecal propionic acid was associated with an increase in T2D risk. In oral glucose tolerance test, a high butyrate-producing microbiota was associated with an improved insulin response (indicating improved beta-cell function), and butyrate concentration was directly related to postprandial insulin sensitivity. Besides, in signal transduction regulation, butyrate could also inhibit HDAC expression in juvenile diabetic rats to modulate the p38/ERK/MAPK signaling pathway, which ultimately prevents beta-cell apoptosis and improves glucose homeostasis.",18120409.0,B-3FloB5l5,4uZf9pm4rR,beta-cell,739.0,748.0,Cellline,975.0,987.0,p38/ERK/MAPK,Species,None
"Experimental research confirms the hypothesis regarding SCFA reduction in autoimmune diseases (MS among others) and altered gut microbiota. A low level of SCFAs dysregulates Treg cell functions, leading to insufficient immune tolerance towards endogenous components and enteric microbiota. However, this process can be reversed by SCFAs supplementation (e.g., propionic acid). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing NFkappaB activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation and on microglial cells in vitro. TUDCA binds to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) expressed in microglial cells. This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS). Experimental results demonstrated that TUDCA acted as a double-edged sword, triggering microglia enhancement in anti-inflammatory and alternatively activated markers and on the other hand reducing the infiltration of macrophages and microglia with expressed pro-inflammatory markers. Interestingly, during neuroinflammation, microglial cells change their morphology, converting themselves into reactive macrophage-like forms. However, microglial cells are flexible, as they can sometimes polarize towards alternatively activated phenotypes, promoting CNS pathologies (proinflammatory or M1 microglia), or exert anti-inflammatory effects, boosting cell repair and remodeling. Bile acids were identified as nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor agonists, leading to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) depletion (in a mouse model) and neuroinflammatory process adjustment. The administration of the complex probiotic positively influenced the intestinal flora balance in patients diagnosed with MS. The probiotic prevented the onset of dysbiosis, significantly increasing the amount of Methanobrevibacter and Akkermansia, Prevotella, and Sutterella in MS patients, influencing gene expression and the production of beneficial bacterial metabolites.",16224291.0,HcEskZuEew,yNw_oNNUBQ,MS,422.0,424.0,Disease,513.0,523.0,bile acids,Chemical,Associated_with

"At the end of this chapter, it is worth mentioning the fact that the interaction between the microbiome and the host is bidirectional, and some metabolic changes, which could be a pathological result of disease progression, also influence microbiome metabolism. A good example is a disturbance in cholesterol homeostasis, which correlates with an augmented probability of Alzheimer's disease occurrence. In addition, alteration of the intestinal microbiota composition with the subsequent fluctuations in the serum and brain levels of bile acids (BAs) is involved in the development of AD. BAs can act as detergents, affecting BBB permeability, and incrementing brain influx of peripheral cholesterol and BAs. Therefore, proper cholesterol elimination pathways play a crucial role in AD prevention and treatment. The gut microbiome is a main ""organ"" metabolizing secondary bile acids. Peripheral cholesterol is eliminated mainly through its liver conversion to BAs. The gut microbiota performs BA transformation via deconjugation and dehydroxylation, leading to secondary BA formation. Nho et al. investigated the correlation between neurodegeneration and BAs, B-amyloid, and tau protein concentration. The application of targeted metabolomics enabled the determination of the association between intestinal microbiota-derived secondary bile acids and sera BAs. Interestingly, the analysis indicated an imbalanced BA ratio, underlying an increased amount of secondary BAs over primary ones. Another clinical study confirmed the correlation between bile acid metabolic profile and the prevalence of AD and mild cognitive impairment, showing similar BA ratio disruptions. Decreased cognitive functions were positively associated with increased concentrations of secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid, and glycolithocholic acid. The described results suggested the involvement of the pathological gut microbiota in AD development; however, still it requires more in-depth studies.",16559364.0,ZpztYKMb-a,7rdVsyFClX,gut microbiota,970.0,984.0,Species,1062.0,1074.0,secondary BA,Chemical,start

"The gut microbiota is critical to human health, such as digesting nutrients, forming the intestinal epithelial barrier, regulating immune function, producing vitamins and hormones, and producing metabolites to interact with the host. Meanwhile, increasing evidence indicates that the gut microbiota has a strong correlation with the occurrence, progression and treatment of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). In patients with CVDs and corresponding risk factors, the composition and ratio of gut microbiota have significant differences compared with their healthy counterparts. Therefore, gut microbiota dysbiosis, gut microbiota-generated metabolites, and the related signaling pathway may serve as explanations for some of the mechanisms about the occurrence and development of CVDs. Several studies have also demonstrated that many traditional and latest therapeutic treatments of CVDs are associated with the gut microbiota and its generated metabolites and related signaling pathways. Given that information, we summarized the latest advances in the current research regarding the effect of gut microbiota on health, the main cardiovascular risk factors, and CVDs, highlighted the roles and mechanisms of several metabolites, and introduced corresponding promising treatments for CVDs regarding the gut microbiota.

"BAs, as by-products of cholesterol metabolism, are the main organic component of bile and are synthesized in hepatocytes. Cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) are primary BAs directly synthesized from cholesterol; secondary BAs include deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholic acid (LCA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and their glycine and taurine conjugated forms. BAs are excreted into the intestine to aid in the digestion and absorption of lipids and combine with farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and takeda-G-protein receptor 5 (TGR5) (Fig. 2). There is a strong biochemical relationship between BAs and gut microbiota. Some gut microbiota in healthy people can convert conjugated BAs into free BAs, and can transform BAs into secondary BAs with the help of bile salt hydrolase (BSH) and cholesterol 7-alpha hydroxy-lase (CYP7A1), so as to reduce blood cholesterol by affecting the enterohepatic circulation of BAs. Besides, the gut microbiota affects the metabolism of BAs by regulating the activity of BSH to reduce LDL cholesterol levels. BAs have bacteriostatic properties and an antimicrobial effect. BAs destroy the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane and thereby change the intestinal microecology. BAs also prevent bacteria from overgrowth and decrease inflammation. More importantly, BAs are also closely associated with CVDs. For example, BAs levels in the feces of patients with CVDs are different from those in healthy individuals. And BAs have been reported to regulate vascular tension and affect ion exchange on cardiomyocyte membranes, suggesting that regulating BAs by gut microbiota might be a treatment for CVDs.",17301489.0,oz2m-VCAiv,haZLHFSvVW,gut microbiota,631.0,645.0,Species,676.0,690.0,conjugated BAs,Chemical,affects

"SCFAs may prevent obesity by regulating the homeostasis of glucose and lipid metabolism. For instance, acetate decreases appetite and nutrient intake. Propionate activates intestinal gluconeogenesis by a gut-brain neural circuit to promote energy balance. Butyrate provides energy for colon cells, maintains the integrity of intestinal walls, and improves the insulin response, which activates gluconeogenesis to maintain the balance of glucose and energy through the cAMP pathway. And one study indicated that oral butyrate intake prevents obesity and insulin resistance. Furthermore, the role of SCFAs in metabolic hemostasis is related to other factors. Adenosine monophosphate activating protein (AMPK) is a heterotrimeric enzyme that stimulates liver and muscle fatty acid oxidation pathways. SCFAs promote the activity of AMPK and improve its ability to oxidize fatty acids. Last, SCFAs can affect the development of dyslipidemia. SCFAs increase the expression of fasting-induced adipose factor (FIAF), a circulating lipoprotein lipase inhibitor, by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-gamma), thereby decreasing the activity of lipoproteinases and inhibiting lipolysis in adipose tissues.

"Aromatic amino acids including tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine are metabolized into indole and phenols by certain intestinal anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, and Peptostreptococcus. Tryptophan is decomposed into indole, indoleacetic acid, indole-3-lactic acid, 3-methylindole (skatole) and other indole compounds under the action of tryptophanase. Tryptophanase is the key enzyme that generates indole. The activity of the enzyme is easily induced by the substrate tryptophan, so when the amount of tryptophan changes in the colonic environment, the content of indole will fluctuate greatly. Of note, the metabolic products of aromatic amino acids generated by gut microbiota have a great impact on the pathology of cardiometabolic diseases. For example, indole propionic acid is associated with insulin sensitivity and appears to reduce the risk of diabetes. Moreover, the gut microbiota metabolizes dietary tryptophan to indoxyl, which further generates indoxyl sulfate through sulfonation. Excessive accumulation of indoxyl sulfate causes cardiomyocyte damage and increases thrombus formation. Another phenol compound, 4-methylphenol, can inhibit the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into mature adipocytes, induce apoptosis and reduce glucose uptake.

"TMAO has been mechanistically linked to atherosclerosis and is also proposed as a promotor and predictor of clinical vascular events in CAD. Plasma TMAO levels are associated with long-term risks of cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndrome, at least in particular related to its pro-inflammatory capacity, promoting the adhesion ability of aortic endothelial cells. In mechanism, TMAO enhances platelet hyperreactivity by altering Ca2+ signaling and elicits a pro-thrombotic effect. Especially, TMAO seems to induce systemic inflammation that contributes to CAD progression. This is particularly relevant given that TMAO directly activates inflammatory pathways, and elicits perturbations in membrane dynamics in human aortic ECs and smooth muscle cells. In particular, the exosomes secreted by TMAO-stimulated hepatocytes increase the secretion of TNF-alpha and IL-6, and further promote inflammation.",18896134.0,3396,8s5LIkosE2,TMAO,402.0,406.0,Chemical,416.0,440.0,platelet hyperreactivity,Disease,increase

"Recently, bacterial strains producing SCFAs have gained extreme popularity. SCFAs are small organic monocarboxylic acids, released after the fermentation of indigestible alimentary fiber (mainly galacto- or fructooligosaccharides), plant-derived polysaccharides, or the metabolism of amino acids, and are considered a key gut-derived metabolites with beneficial health effects and as essential in gut-brain crosstalk. The type of formed SCFAs is correlated with the kind of fiber ingested and the overall gut microbiota population. For example, microbes belonging to Firmicutes phyla (e.g., Lachnospiraceae, Eubacterium, or Roseburia belonging to the Clostridia class) are responsible for the main production of butyrate, whereas Bifidobacteria spp. produce lactate and acetate. SCFAs are significantly reduced during dysbiosis, where disrupted gut epithelial integrity, inflammation, and altered microbiome metabolic processes occur. In a healthy colon, levels of SCFAs can vary depending on a diet; however, in multiple diseases, these levels are altered. SCFAs may also act in an indirect or direct way through G-protein-coupled receptors or as histone deacetylase epigenetic modulators. They participate in various physiological processes, such as cell energetics and colonocyte metabolism and skeletal, adipose, and liver tissue modulation. Their major functions comprise the activation of trophic factors, energy management, and the manufacturing of regulatory T-cells. Short-chain fatty acids can be considered as key intermediaries in numerous neurological diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, stroke, and neuropsychiatric conditions.",16409429.0,s_Why9dAoi,330,Lachnospiraceae,591.0,606.0,Species,712.0,720.0,butyrate,Chemical,start
"In fact, changes in the function of gut microecology and gut microbiota may cause the occurrence and exacerbation of various diseases. It was found that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota may lead to decreased cardiac function and increased cardiomyopathy as well as cardiac insufficiency, which is of great significance in predicting CVDs and also has important predictive significance for the prognosis of adverse cardiovascular events. The gut microbiota has been reported to be associated with CVDs and its corresponding risk factors, such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, and insulin resistance. These risk factors may affect the composition and the diversity of gut microbiota. In addition, gut dysbiosis is also linked to inflammation, oxidative stress, platelet activity, thrombosis and atherosclerosis, which contribute to the progression of CVDs. The possible mechanism of gut microbiota dysbiosis related to CVDs includes its role in increasing intestinal permeability and triggering inflammation via the LPS/TLR4 as well as NLRP3 pathways, thereby ultimately contributing to the development of CVDs. In short, the inflammation directly triggers by gut microbiota is one of the possible mechanisms of CVDs susceptibility, and material metabolism affected by gut microbiota was proposed to play a role as well.",17039945.0,486,488,thrombosis,775.0,785.0,Disease,846.0,850.0,CVDs,Disease,complicates
"However host-microbiota interplay is not exclusively restricted to cell-cell interactions. Intestinal microbes are capable of producing a plethora of different types of compounds, i.e., small molecules (amino acids, neurotransmitters, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and other fatty acid derivatives, indoles, vitamins, and cofactors), polysaccharides, and proteins (i.e., bacteriocins), which have been reported as important factors in shaping the bacterial community and modulation of the immune system. It has been demonstrated that intestinal bacterial strains such as Escherichia coli or Lactobacillus spp. interact directly with the host's CNS (central nervous system), as they can release neurotransmitters such as dopamine, noradrenaline, histamine, acetylcholine, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), or serotonin. This metabolic status of the microbiome is also vulnerable to dysbiosis and compositional changes and often leads to metabolic disturbances. For example, dysbiosis can induce elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, intensifying oxidative stress and neuronal inflammatory processes. It has been estimated that 40% of the metabolites detected in humans are the products of bacterial metabolism, which plays a fundamental role in the modulation of the host's physiological processes, including immune-mediated neurodegeneration or affecting neural cell metabolism.",16115776.0,127,DXaV1U0Gwi,Escherichia coli,573.0,589.0,Species,696.0,713.0,neurotransmitters,Chemical,start

"The PD microbiome has a diminished variety of bacterial taxonomic groups, especially the ones associated with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects and the increase of phyla, which has toxic effects. Predominantly, the reduction was observed in the Lachnospiraceae family, including Butyrivibrio, Pseudobutyrivibrio, Coprococcus, Blautia and SCFAs-producing Prevotellaceae. The increased amount of Enterobacteriaceae is linked to the severity of postural instability and walking difficulties. Moreover, the PD microbiome is characterised by increased Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium species and decreased amount of Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae. The overgrowth of Akkermansia spp. in PD patients may be strain-specific and can be related to immune-response alterations, decreased mucus thicknesses, and increased constipation. Faecalibacterium family is a crucial player producing SCFAs and anti-inflammatory metabolites, maintaining gut health. Faecalibacterium balance disturbances can lead to impaired gut-barrier function, increasing the risk of infection with enteric pathogens and boosting alpha-synuclein formation. Similarly, the Lachnospiraceae family can produce butyrate, important for the proper function of the gut epithelium. Decreased Lachnospiraceae quantity might aggravate gut inflammation, stimulate toxin production, and damage the integrity of the gut epithelial barrier. PD patients' intestinal microflora were characterised by a diminished abundance of Lachnospiraceae, which was positively correlated with PD progress, cognitive decline, and impaired motor functions. These microbiome's compositional changes correlate well with some metabolic switches. PD microbiota show reduced SCFAs production, decreased carbohydrate fermentation, and augmented proteolytic fermentation. Chen et al. demonstrated that the SCFA level was relevant to microbiota composition changes and the clinical severity of PD. The levels of SCFAs acetate, butyrate, and propionate in fecal samples of PD patients were significantly reduced, contrary to their elevated concentration in plasma. Rodent models of PD disease have shown a positive effect of SCFAs on behavior and PD symptoms. Butyrate, as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, exerts neuroprotective activity, reducing dopaminergic cell death, and motor impairment, and improving cognitive functions. Taken together, SCFAs play an important role in protection from PD disease and could be proposed as representative gut-oriented indicators for diversifying individuals with PD and placing disease progression.",16553034.0,993,978,PD,2014.0,2016.0,Disease,1969.0,1977.0,butyrate,Chemical,decrease

"Aromatic amino acids including tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine are metabolized into indole and phenols by certain intestinal anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, and Peptostreptococcus. Tryptophan is decomposed into indole, indoleacetic acid, indole-3-lactic acid, 3-methylindole (skatole) and other indole compounds under the action of tryptophanase. Tryptophanase is the key enzyme that generates indole. The activity of the enzyme is easily induced by the substrate tryptophan, so when the amount of tryptophan changes in the colonic environment, the content of indole will fluctuate greatly. Of note, the metabolic products of aromatic amino acids generated by gut microbiota have a great impact on the pathology of cardiometabolic diseases. For example, indole propionic acid is associated with insulin sensitivity and appears to reduce the risk of diabetes. Moreover, the gut microbiota metabolizes dietary tryptophan to indoxyl, which further generates indoxyl sulfate through sulfonation. Excessive accumulation of indoxyl sulfate causes cardiomyocyte damage and increases thrombus formation. Another phenol compound, 4-methylphenol, can inhibit the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into mature adipocytes, induce apoptosis and reduce glucose uptake. In addition, benzoic acid is an aromatic carboxylic acid synthesized by colonic microorganisms by metabolizing dietary aromatic compounds.

"The gut microbiota is critical to human health, such as digesting nutrients, forming the intestinal epithelial barrier, regulating immune function, producing vitamins and hormones, and producing metabolites to interact with the host.

"Given that the gut microbiota is essential in human health, changes in the composition and function of the gut microbiota may result in the development of diseases. Due to the influence of host genes, diet, antibiotic use, lifestyle, drugs as well as other factors, the composition and diversity of gut microbiota gradually change with interindividual variation. For example, a high-fat diet leads to an increase in the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. When the composition and proportion of gut microbiota change, inflammation and metabolic abnormalities can be induced, which contribute to the development of different diseases. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota refers to changes in the number, species and composition of gut microbiota. In recent years, gut microbiota dysbiosis has been shown to be critically involved in health and has emerged as a potential pathogenesis for various diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, cancers, and CVDs. Moreover, gut dysbiosis is also a driver of metabolic inflammation and metabolic dysregulation, which serve as a key feature of metabolic diseases. For instance, the translocation of intestinal bacteria to the blood and liver through the portal venous system together with its metabolites are able to stimulate the release of inflammatory factors, and promote the occurrence of non-alcoholic fatty liver as well as hepatitis.

"At the end of this chapter, it is worth mentioning the fact that the interaction between the microbiome and the host is bidirectional, and some metabolic changes, which could be a pathological result of disease progression, also influence microbiome metabolism. A good example is a disturbance in cholesterol homeostasis, which correlates with an augmented probability of Alzheimer's disease occurrence. In addition, alteration of the intestinal microbiota composition with the subsequent fluctuations in the serum and brain levels of bile acids (BAs) is involved in the development of AD. BAs can act as detergents, affecting BBB permeability, and incrementing brain influx of peripheral cholesterol and BAs. Therefore, proper cholesterol elimination pathways play a crucial role in AD prevention and treatment. The gut microbiome is a main ""organ"" metabolizing secondary bile acids. Peripheral cholesterol is eliminated mainly through its liver conversion to BAs. The gut microbiota performs BA transformation via deconjugation and dehydroxylation, leading to secondary BA formation. Nho et al. investigated the correlation between neurodegeneration and BAs, B-amyloid, and tau protein concentration. The application of targeted metabolomics enabled the determination of the association between intestinal microbiota-derived secondary bile acids and sera BAs. Interestingly, the analysis indicated an imbalanced BA ratio, underlying an increased amount of secondary BAs over primary ones. Another clinical study confirmed the correlation between bile acid metabolic profile and the prevalence of AD and mild cognitive impairment, showing similar BA ratio disruptions. Decreased cognitive functions were positively associated with increased concentrations of secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid, and glycolithocholic acid.

"Importantly, studies found that the occurrence of CVDs was also involved in the immune response mediated by the NLR family. For example, atherosclerotic plaques in LDLR-/- NOD 1/2-/- mice showed less lipid deposition and macrophage aggregation, suggesting that lack of NOD 1/2 may reduce the occurrence of atherosclerosis. Moreover, the peptidoglycan components in bacteria can bind to NOD1 and NOD2, which in turn mediate the occurrence of the inflammatory response, and further leads to atherosclerosis. Besides, inflammation induced by the NLRP3 inflammasome plays a role in the interaction between gut microbiota and cardiometabolic diseases. For instance, the NLRP3 deficient obese mice had altered composition of the gut microbiota, decreased TMAO and LPS levels, as well as downregulated hepatic steatosis and myocardial energy metabolism. Nevertheless, another study reported that NOD TLR4 -/- mice developed higher body weight, hyperlipidemia, severe insulin, and glucose intolerance, lower circulating SCFAs levels, higher levels of Bacteroidetes, lower levels of Firmicutes in the large intestine, as well as fewer SCFAs-associated gut microbiota, all of which may promote the development of insulin-deficient diabetes.",16855003.0,CVE7Wjsd6X,381,SCFAs-associated gut microbiota,1126.0,1157.0,Species,1203.0,1229.0,insulin-deficient diabetes,Disease,start

"Alzheimer's disease (AD), commonly known as senile dementia, is a chronic, devastating, neurodegenerative, and neuroinflammatory disorder with rising incidence and is considered to be the most frequent form of dementia in aging individuals (caused by aberrant protein processing, trafficking, and aggregation in neural cells). The World Alzheimer Report indicates that 50 million people suffer from AD-related neurological problems and this number will increase to 152 million in 2050. It is predicted that in 2030 up to 66 million people will suffer from AD. AD is a multifactorial disease characterized by synapse loss, extracellular cerebral accumulation of insoluble peptides belonging to amyloid-beta (Abeta), the aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein inside the cells, neurofibrillary mass formation, neuronal death (in the neocortex and hippocampus), progressive memory deterioration, and cognition decline leading to dementia. AD is associated with more than 700 genetic and environmental risk factors. From the genetic point of view, one of the most important risk factors related to AD development is the incidence of a ""4 allele variant in the apolipoprotein"" (APOE4) gene, which is associated with cholesterol transport in CNS, and also contributes to metabolomic and taxonomic changes in the microbiome.",16422307.0,389,FT-PepAd4K,people,380.0,386.0,Species,399.0,431.0,AD-related neurological problems,Disease,experiences
"Scientific evidence indicates that the metabolic status of microbiota exerts a more important role than the equilibrium between bacterial species. Microbial metabolites can act as positive modulators of the gut-brain-axis constituents, boosting the immune cells and exerting a positive/protective effect on neurodegenerative disease progression. On the other hand, disrupted equilibrium between microbial species often leads to specific switches in the microbial metabolome, which may be harmful and associated with neurodegenerative disease progression. For example, dysregulation of Gram-negative bacteria in the gastrointestinal area leads to the production of harmful metabolites (i.e., endo- and exotoxins, saccharides, and amyloids). Exotoxins, such as LPS, which have the ability to activate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, exert negative effects. LPS belongs to glycolipid molecules, mostly produced by Gram-negative bacterial strains. These molecules participate in the integrity maintenance of the bacterial outer-membrane permeability barrier, playing an important role in host-pathogen interplay. The overproduction of bacterial LPS can cause the activation of the macrophage-monocyte nod-like receptor P3 inflammasome, therefore stimulating the production of cytokines with pro-inflammatory activity, such as IL-18 or IL-1beta. LPS can be translocated and intensify neuroinflammatory diseases such as AD. Additionally, it was demonstrated that IL-1beta can decrease the phagocytic function of microglial cells, stimulating the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, and causing reduced synaptic plasticity and cognitive deterioration.

"Previous results have indicated that the metabolic regulation of BAs may be associated with T2D but the specific changes in BAs and the related mechanisms remain to be studied.

A study also suggested that patients with T2D had no change in plasma total BAs, but had an increase in DCA and a decrease in CDCA in plasma. Another study found that the plasma total BA concentration in patients with T2D was not significantly different from that of healthy people; however, the concentration of DCA in the plasma of patients with T2D was significantly higher than that of healthy controls. The mechanism may be that FXR and TGR5 are inhibited during insulin resistance, and the most effective natural ligands of the receptors, DCA and CA, are compensatorily increased. Besides, circulating BAs levels including DCA, TCA, TDCA, and glycodeoxycholic acid, are positively associated with the risk of T2D, while taurohyodeoxycholic acid is negatively associated with diabetes.

"In the past decade, single dietary factors which can positively manipulate the gut microbiota-brain axis through microbiome modulation have gained significant attention. One of these factors is probiotic bacteria and/or prebiotics. Probiotics are defined as microbial organisms with a beneficial role in the host's health and homeostasis, which help to preserve digestive, metabolic, immune, and neuroendocrine functions. Naturally probiotic bacteria can be found in fermented food. Experimental results revealed that the administration of probiotics alone or in combination with prebiotics (fructooligosaccharides or galactooligosaccharides) improved the gastrointestinal barrier, which is the first line of ""defence"" from harmful factors occurring in food, and the microbiome. Probiotics and prebiotics are well-documented ""problem-solution"" for gastrointestinal diseases. Moreover, probiotics can reduce CNS inflammatory processes and activation of microglia, demonstrating promising potential for use in neurodegenerative diseases as ingestible ""psychobiotics"". Many studies indicate that the ingestion of probiotics can serve as a microbiological strategy against neurodegenerative diseases such as AD; however, the exact mechanism is under investigation. Experiments performed on mice underline the hypothesis that mechanisms related to neuroprotective effects of Bifidobacterium breve administration may be connected with neuroinflammation and cognition pathways, probably through the production of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) neurotransmitter and the regulation of the gut microbial composition. Clinical results of a randomized double-blind controlled trial revealed that 3-month exposure to Lactobacillus spp. And a Bifidobacterium bifidum ""cocktail"" enhanced cognitive functions and memory, as examined in a mini-mental state test. It was demonstrated that Bifidobacterium breve exerts positive and unique activity in AD patients, improving cognitive functions and reducing neuroinflammation.

"At the end of this chapter, it is worth mentioning the fact that the interaction between the microbiome and the host is bidirectional, and some metabolic changes, which could be a pathological result of disease progression, also influence microbiome metabolism. A good example is a disturbance in cholesterol homeostasis, which correlates with an augmented probability of Alzheimer's disease occurrence. In addition, alteration of the intestinal microbiota composition with the subsequent fluctuations in the serum and brain levels of bile acids (BAs) is involved in the development of AD. BAs can act as detergents, affecting BBB permeability, and incrementing brain influx of peripheral cholesterol and BAs. Therefore, proper cholesterol elimination pathways play a crucial role in AD prevention and treatment. The gut microbiome is a main ""organ"" metabolizing secondary bile acids. Peripheral cholesterol is eliminated mainly through its liver conversion to BAs. The gut microbiota performs BA transformation via deconjugation and dehydroxylation, leading to secondary BA formation. Nho et al. investigated the correlation between neurodegeneration and BAs, B-amyloid, and tau protein concentration. The application of targeted metabolomics enabled the determination of the association between intestinal microbiota-derived secondary bile acids and sera BAs. Interestingly, the analysis indicated an imbalanced BA ratio, underlying an increased amount of secondary BAs over primary ones. Another clinical study confirmed the correlation between bile acid metabolic profile and the prevalence of AD and mild cognitive impairment, showing similar BA ratio disruptions. Decreased cognitive functions were positively associated with increased concentrations of secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid, and glycolithocholic acid.

"Aromatic amino acids including tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine are metabolized into indole and phenols by certain intestinal anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, and Peptostreptococcus. Tryptophan is decomposed into indole, indoleacetic acid, indole-3-lactic acid, 3-methylindole (skatole) and other indole compounds under the action of tryptophanase. Tryptophanase is the key enzyme that generates indole. The activity of the enzyme is easily induced by the substrate tryptophan, so when the amount of tryptophan changes in the colonic environment, the content of indole will fluctuate greatly. Of note, the metabolic products of aromatic amino acids generated by gut microbiota have a great impact on the pathology of cardiometabolic diseases. For example, indole propionic acid is associated with insulin sensitivity and appears to reduce the risk of diabetes. Moreover, the gut microbiota metabolizes dietary tryptophan to indoxyl, which further generates indoxyl sulfate through sulfonation. Excessive accumulation of indoxyl sulfate causes cardiomyocyte damage and increases thrombus formation. Another phenol compound, 4-methylphenol, can inhibit the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into mature adipocytes, induce apoptosis and reduce glucose uptake.

"The gut microbiota is critical to human health, such as digesting nutrients, forming the intestinal epithelial barrier, regulating immune function, producing vitamins and hormones, and producing metabolites to interact with the host. Meanwhile, increasing evidence indicates that the gut microbiota has a strong correlation with the occurrence, progression and treatment of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). In patients with CVDs and corresponding risk factors, the composition and ratio of gut microbiota have significant differences compared with their healthy counterparts. Therefore, gut microbiota dysbiosis, gut microbiota-generated metabolites, and the related signaling pathway may serve as explanations for some of the mechanisms about the occurrence and development of CVDs. Several studies have also demonstrated that many traditional and latest therapeutic treatments of CVDs are associated with the gut microbiota and its generated metabolites and related signaling pathways. Given that information, we summarized the latest advances in the current research regarding the effect of gut microbiota on health, the main cardiovascular risk factors, and CVDs, highlighted the roles and mechanisms of several metabolites, and introduced corresponding promising treatments for CVDs regarding the gut microbiota. Therefore, this review mainly focuses on exploring the role of gut microbiota related metabolites and their therapeutic potential in CVDs, which may eventually provide better solutions in the development of therapeutic treatment as well as the prevention of CVDs.",16509972.0,21,22,dysbiosis,601.0,610.0,Disease,777.0,781.0,CVDs,Disease,Marker/Mechanism
"The analysis of the intestinal microbiome of adolescent and adult ADHD patients (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) indicated changes and imbalances in the gut microbiota followed by elevated levels of Bifidobacterium and Eggerthella genera related to boosted dopamine precursor formation and connected with ADHD development. Some reports indicated the implication of the microbiome in the regulation of brain dopamine levels. The Bifidobacterium genus plays an important role in dopamine precursor production (cyclohexadienyl dehydratase) in ADHD patients. Jiang et al. reported a reduction of Faecalibacterium spp. in paediatric patients diagnosed with ADHD and they suggested Faecalibacterium as a new marker of ADHD. Faecalibacterium depletion was followed by increased cytokine levels and inflammation. Interestingly, three bacterial species (Bacteroides uniformis, Bacteroides ovatus, and Sutterella stercoricanis) were identified as potential biomarkers of ADHD. Tengeler et al. reported increased anxiety in a GF mice model with human microbiota transplanted from ADHD-suffering individuals.

"The mechanism by which BCAAs induce insulin resistance is still not fully understood. The rise of BCAA levels is found to regulate glycolipid metabolism, cause insulin resistance, and increase the risk of T2D. Other animal experiments have shown that elevated BCAAs are transferred to skeletal muscle, and are interfered with lipid metabolism, which causes the accumulation of lipid metabolites and ultimately leads to skeletal muscle insulin resistance. Additionally, BCAAs are the key regulatory factor of mTORC1. It activates mTORC1 and ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (S6K1) by inducing the phosphorylation of IRS1, blocking the insulin signaling pathway, and eventually causing insulin resistance. However, 2 other studies have shown that BCAAs may exert their functions without mTORC1. One study reported that the metabolites of BCAAs, 3-hydroxy isobutyrate, could cause insulin resistance by promoting skeletal muscle sprouting. Another study reported that a diet rich in BCAAs can cause overeating, obesity, and shortened lifespan, which was not related to the mTOR signaling pathway in the liver but is mainly due to hyperphagia.",18449544.0,aGzo9pwBo1,2359,BCAAs,469.0,474.0,Chemical,617.0,621.0,IRS1,Species,affects

"It has been proven that risk factors for civilization diseases such as stroke and cardiovascular diseases are also associated with the diversity of the intestinal flora. The abovementioned factors comprise atherosclerosis and hypertension. Moreover, the dysregulation of microbiota was observed in patients with stroke together with increased plasma and urinary concentrations of the proatherosclerotic gut bacterial metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), also co-responsible for the development of cardiovascular diseases (atherosclerotic coronary artery disease among others), AD, and gestational diabetes. TMAO is produced from dietary phosphatidylcholine by the intestinal microbiota. Preclinical models of cerebral ischemia indicate the coexistence of pathological microflora which negatively affect intestinal permeability and motility. Some reported experimental results indicate the relationship of intestinal microbiota with neuroinflammatory processes by modulating intestinal T-cell trafficking to the CNS.

"It is well investigated that BCAAs have a significant positive correlation with blood glucose, blood lipids, and the insulin resistance index, and can be used as potential biomarkers for the early prediction of diabetes. One study indicated that three BCAAs (leucine, isoleucine, and valine), and two aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine and tyrosine) were significantly increased 10 years before the onset of diabetes. The increased BCAAs-induced insulin resistance was associated with the presence of Prevotella copri and Bacteroides vulgatus. The major groups of gut bacteria that biosynthesize BCAAs are Prevotella copri and Bacteroides vulgatus, and the insulin resistance caused by elevated BCAAs levels is associated with the presence of these two bacteria.

"In summary, the gut microbiota generates a series of bioactive metabolites to interact with host metabolism. These metabolites mainly include SCFAs, primary and secondary BAs, TMAO, and so on. Among these metabolites, some exert synergistic effects to promote host health by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system to control glucose metabolism. For example, SCFAs interact with human hormones such as GLP-1 and PYY to effect energy uptake and the development of obesity. SCFAs are beneficial for regulating appetite and energy intake, and preventing the formation of atherosclerosis. Other metabolites, such as TMAO and phenylacetylglutamine (PAGln), may be toxic. For example, TMAO may be proatherogenic to promote the process of thrombosis and atherosclerosis, thereby increasing the risk of cardiovascular events. Patients with CVDs had lower levels of SCFA generation and higher levels of TMAO production due to the change in gut microbiota. Furthermore, TMAO causes vascular endothelial damage and promotes the production of atherosclerotic plaques. TMAO can also increase the release of intracellular calcium ions, enhance the reactivity of platelets, and increase the risk of thrombosis to increase CVDs susceptibility. Besides, PAGln enhances platelet reactivity and thrombosis, leading to CVDs. Taken together, mounting evidence suggests that changes in gut microbiota metabolites are part of the crucial mechanisms by which the gut microbiota regulates the occurrence and development of CVDs.",18055127.0,1171,veEOLi8JSF,CVDs,1505.0,1509.0,Disease,1371.0,1397.0,gut microbiota metabolites,Chemical,None

Previous studies showed that the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota could lead to the rapid proliferation of intestinal pathogenic bacteria, and the pro-inflammatory factors released by them seriously damaged the structure and function of the intestinal barrier, and it also promoted the occurrence and development of diseases in the digestive system as well as metabolic system. Furthermore, the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota triggers intestinal mucosal barrier damage, leading to inflammation and disordered nutrient metabolism.

"Importantly, studies found that the occurrence of CVDs was also involved in the immune response mediated by the NLR family. For example, atherosclerotic plaques in LDLR-/- NOD 1/2-/- mice showed less lipid deposition and macrophage aggregation, suggesting that lack of NOD 1/2 may reduce the occurrence of atherosclerosis. Moreover, the peptidoglycan components in bacteria can bind to NOD1 and NOD2, which in turn mediate the occurrence of the inflammatory response, and further leads to atherosclerosis. Besides, inflammation induced by the NLRP3 inflammasome plays a role in the interaction between gut microbiota and cardiometabolic diseases. For instance, the NLRP3 deficient obese mice had altered composition of the gut microbiota, decreased TMAO and LPS levels, as well as downregulated hepatic steatosis and myocardial energy metabolism. Nevertheless, another study reported that NOD TLR4 -/- mice developed higher body weight, hyperlipidemia, severe insulin, and glucose intolerance, lower circulating SCFAs levels, higher levels of Bacteroidetes, lower levels of Firmicutes in the large intestine, as well as fewer SCFAs-associated gut microbiota, all of which may promote the development of insulin-deficient diabetes.",16855003.0,UY1FbugXFv,JDZ_skuUrR,SCFAs,1012.0,1017.0,Chemical,602.0,616.0,gut microbiota,Species,None

It has been reported that butyrate and other SCFAs can cross the gastrointestinal endothelium and can pass through the BBB (exploiting active membrane transporters) and inhibit histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1).

"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal health condition caused by the progressive neural death of the spinal cord, brain stem, and motor cortex neurons, causing advanced weakness, paralysis, eating difficulties, and respiratory failure. One of the main signs of ALS is the accumulation of phosphorylated protein, which binds to DNA in the form of protein aggregates deposited in glia and motor neurons.

Changes in bacterial abundance and diversity correlate with ASL origins (as one of the environmental factors) together with impaired metabolism, immunological functions, and toxin accumulation, leading to brain damage. It has been demonstrated that Akkermansia muciniphila alleviates ALS symptoms, although Ruminococcus torques and Parabacteroides distasonis aggravate them.

"Besides the propagation of an inflammatory state, microbial endotoxins are probably involved in AD's inflammatory amyloidosis. Metagenomics analysis showed that patients suffering from cognitive dysfunctions related to amyloidosis demonstrated elevated amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neurotoxic compounds. In these patients, increased inflammation was probably related to Eubacterium deficiency, and an overabundance of gram-negative Escherichia and Shigella species, which are known amyloid producers. They manufacture ""curli"" amyloid fibers, accumulated extracellularly through an elaborated system. Further studies revealed that the overproduction of Abeta plaques is correlated with excessive growth of Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycobacterium and Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus spp..

Mice with higher levels of non-12-OH BAs gained weight slowly and had less metabolic disturbance, while the rapidly gaining weight mice had significantly lower levels of non-12-OH BAs such as UDCA. UDCA intake significantly reduced weight gain and metabolic disturbances induced by high-fat diet. Another study also provided evidence that a high-fat diet caused obesity by increasing the levels of 12-OH BAs. In a rat model, high-fat diet caused increases in the total BAs, DCA and taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA) in plasma and liver tissues, and increases in DCA in intestinal tissues and feces.

"BAs, as by-products of cholesterol metabolism, are the main organic component of bile and are synthesized in hepatocytes. Cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) are primary BAs directly synthesized from cholesterol; secondary BAs include deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholic acid (LCA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and their glycine and taurine conjugated forms. BAs are excreted into the intestine to aid in the digestion and absorption of lipids and combine with farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and takeda-G-protein receptor 5 (TGR5) (Fig. 2). There is a strong biochemical relationship between BAs and gut microbiota. Some gut microbiota in healthy people can convert conjugated BAs into free BAs, and can transform BAs into secondary BAs with the help of bile salt hydrolase (BSH) and cholesterol 7-alpha hydroxy-lase (CYP7A1), so as to reduce blood cholesterol by affecting the enterohepatic circulation of BAs. Besides, the gut microbiota affects the metabolism of BAs by regulating the activity of BSH to reduce LDL cholesterol levels. BAs have bacteriostatic properties and an antimicrobial effect. BAs destroy the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane and thereby change the intestinal microecology. BAs also prevent bacteria from overgrowth and decrease inflammation. More importantly, BAs are also closely associated with CVDs. For example, BAs levels in the feces of patients with CVDs are different from those in healthy individuals. And BAs have been reported to regulate vascular tension and affect ion exchange on cardiomyocyte membranes, suggesting that regulating BAs by gut microbiota might be a treatment for CVDs.",17301489.0,878,c14s8LjamL,patients,1387.0,1395.0,Species,764.0,783.0,bile salt hydrolase,Chemical,None
"Mechanically, current studies suggest that SCFAs may exert their functions through acting as energy substrates and maintaining metabolic integration by a variety of different downstream regulatory mechanisms, such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPRs) with GPR41/Recombinant Free Fatty Acid Receptor (FFAR3), GPR43/FFAR2, GPR109A, Olfactory Receptors 78 (Olfr78) in endocrine cells of the gut wall, as well as histone deacetylases (HDACs) (Fig. 2). GPR41 regulates host energy acquisition and promotes the catabolism of glucose and lipids. The decreased SCFAs may cause less activated GPR41 and higher levels of energy uptake. In addition, it has also been reported that the lower production of SCFAs in gut microbiota would increase the host's capability of obtaining energy from the diet. SCFAs from bacterial fermentation promote the secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY) through GPR43 and GPR41 from intestinal L cells. GLP-1 increased pancreatic insulin secretion, and inhibited the production of glucagon. Deletion of GLP-1 abolished the beneficial effects of prebiotics on weight gain, glucose metabolism, and inflammatory pathway activation. Moreover, PYY increases satiety, reduces food intake, inhibits intestinal motility, and increases the intestinal transit rate.",18395273.0,693,701,SCFAs,43.0,48.0,Chemical,315.0,320.0,FFAR2,Gene,Interacts_with
"Given that the gut microbiota is essential in human health, changes in the composition and function of the gut microbiota may result in the development of diseases. Due to the influence of host genes, diet, antibiotic use, lifestyle, drugs as well as other factors, the composition and diversity of gut microbiota gradually change with interindividual variation. For example, a high-fat diet leads to an increase in the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. When the composition and proportion of gut microbiota change, inflammation and metabolic abnormalities can be induced, which contribute to the development of different diseases. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota refers to changes in the number, species and composition of gut microbiota. In recent years, gut microbiota dysbiosis has been shown to be critically involved in health and has emerged as a potential pathogenesis for various diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, cancers, and CVDs. Moreover, gut dysbiosis is also a driver of metabolic inflammation and metabolic dysregulation, which serve as a key feature of metabolic diseases. For instance, the translocation of intestinal bacteria to the blood and liver through the portal venous system together with its metabolites are able to stimulate the release of inflammatory factors, and promote the occurrence of non-alcoholic fatty liver as well as hepatitis.

"SCFAs may prevent obesity by regulating the homeostasis of glucose and lipid metabolism. For instance, acetate decreases appetite and nutrient intake. Propionate activates intestinal gluconeogenesis by a gut-brain neural circuit to promote energy balance. Butyrate provides energy for colon cells, maintains the integrity of intestinal walls, and improves the insulin response, which activates gluconeogenesis to maintain the balance of glucose and energy through the cAMP pathway. And one study indicated that oral butyrate intake prevents obesity and insulin resistance. Furthermore, the role of SCFAs in metabolic hemostasis is related to other factors. Adenosine monophosphate activating protein (AMPK) is a heterotrimeric enzyme that stimulates liver and muscle fatty acid oxidation pathways. SCFAs promote the activity of AMPK and improve its ability to oxidize fatty acids. Last, SCFAs can affect the development of dyslipidemia. SCFAs increase the expression of fasting-induced adipose factor (FIAF), a circulating lipoprotein lipase inhibitor, by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-gamma), thereby decreasing the activity of lipoproteinases and inhibiting lipolysis in adipose tissues.

"In the past decade, single dietary factors which can positively manipulate the gut microbiota-brain axis through microbiome modulation have gained significant attention. One of these factors is probiotic bacteria and/or prebiotics. Probiotics are defined as microbial organisms with a beneficial role in the host's health and homeostasis, which help to preserve digestive, metabolic, immune, and neuroendocrine functions. Naturally probiotic bacteria can be found in fermented food. Experimental results revealed that the administration of probiotics alone or in combination with prebiotics (fructooligosaccharides or galactooligosaccharides) improved the gastrointestinal barrier, which is the first line of ""defence"" from harmful factors occurring in food, and the microbiome. Probiotics and prebiotics are well-documented ""problem-solution"" for gastrointestinal diseases. Moreover, probiotics can reduce CNS inflammatory processes and activation of microglia, demonstrating promising potential for use in neurodegenerative diseases as ingestible ""psychobiotics"". Many studies indicate that the ingestion of probiotics can serve as a microbiological strategy against neurodegenerative diseases such as AD; however, the exact mechanism is under investigation. Experiments performed on mice underline the hypothesis that mechanisms related to neuroprotective effects of Bifidobacterium breve administration may be connected with neuroinflammation and cognition pathways, probably through the production of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) neurotransmitter and the regulation of the gut microbial composition. Clinical results of a randomized double-blind controlled trial revealed that 3-month exposure to Lactobacillus spp. And a Bifidobacterium bifidum ""cocktail"" enhanced cognitive functions and memory, as examined in a mini-mental state test.

"Recently, bacterial strains producing SCFAs have gained extreme popularity. SCFAs are small organic monocarboxylic acids, released after the fermentation of indigestible alimentary fiber (mainly galacto- or fructooligosaccharides), plant-derived polysaccharides, or the metabolism of amino acids, and are considered a key gut-derived metabolites with beneficial health effects and as essential in gut-brain crosstalk. The type of formed SCFAs is correlated with the kind of fiber ingested and the overall gut microbiota population. For example, microbes belonging to Firmicutes phyla (e.g., Lachnospiraceae, Eubacterium, or Roseburia belonging to the Clostridia class) are responsible for the main production of butyrate, whereas Bifidobacteria spp. produce lactate and acetate. SCFAs are significantly reduced during dysbiosis, where disrupted gut epithelial integrity, inflammation, and altered microbiome metabolic processes occur. In a healthy colon, levels of SCFAs can vary depending on a diet; however, in multiple diseases, these levels are altered. SCFAs may also act in an indirect or direct way through G-protein-coupled receptors or as histone deacetylase epigenetic modulators. They participate in various physiological processes, such as cell energetics and colonocyte metabolism and skeletal, adipose, and liver tissue modulation. Their major functions comprise the activation of trophic factors, energy management, and the manufacturing of regulatory T-cells.

"Importantly, studies found that the occurrence of CVDs was also involved in the immune response mediated by the NLR family.

Moreover, the peptidoglycan components in bacteria can bind to NOD1 and NOD2, which in turn mediate the occurrence of the inflammatory response, and further leads to atherosclerosis.

"Experimental research confirms the hypothesis regarding SCFA reduction in autoimmune diseases (MS among others) and altered gut microbiota. A low level of SCFAs dysregulates Treg cell functions, leading to insufficient immune tolerance towards endogenous components and enteric microbiota. However, this process can be reversed by SCFAs supplementation (e.g., propionic acid). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing NFkappaB activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation and on microglial cells in vitro. TUDCA binds to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) expressed in microglial cells. This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS). Experimental results demonstrated that TUDCA acted as a double-edged sword, triggering microglia enhancement in anti-inflammatory and alternatively activated markers and on the other hand reducing the infiltration of macrophages and microglia with expressed pro-inflammatory markers. Interestingly, during neuroinflammation, microglial cells change their morphology, converting themselves into reactive macrophage-like forms. However, microglial cells are flexible, as they can sometimes polarize towards alternatively activated phenotypes, promoting CNS pathologies (proinflammatory or M1 microglia), or exert anti-inflammatory effects, boosting cell repair and remodeling. Bile acids were identified as nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor agonists, leading to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) depletion (in a mouse model) and neuroinflammatory process adjustment. The administration of the complex probiotic positively influenced the intestinal flora balance in patients diagnosed with MS. The probiotic prevented the onset of dysbiosis, significantly increasing the amount of Methanobrevibacter and Akkermansia, Prevotella, and Sutterella in MS patients, influencing gene expression and the production of beneficial bacterial metabolites.",16224291.0,MGmwre--Uk,1293,microglial cells,1114.0,1130.0,Cellline,1095.0,1099.0,TGR5,Species,Location_of

The gut microbiota has been reported to be associated with CVDs and its corresponding risk factors, such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, and insulin resistance.

"The mechanism by which BCAAs induce insulin resistance is still not fully understood. The rise of BCAA levels is found to regulate glycolipid metabolism, cause insulin resistance, and increase the risk of T2D. Other animal experiments have shown that elevated BCAAs are transferred to skeletal muscle, and are interfered with lipid metabolism, which causes the accumulation of lipid metabolites and ultimately leads to skeletal muscle insulin resistance. Additionally, BCAAs are the key regulatory factor of mTORC1. It activates mTORC1 and ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (S6K1) by inducing the phosphorylation of IRS1, blocking the insulin signaling pathway, and eventually causing insulin resistance. However, 2 other studies have shown that BCAAs may exert their functions without mTORC1. One study reported that the metabolites of BCAAs, 3-hydroxy isobutyrate, could cause insulin resistance by promoting skeletal muscle sprouting.

It has been reported that LPS is important in the development of cardiometabolic diseases. Moreover, studies showed that the high-fat diet could result in decreased intestinal levels of gram-positive Bifidobacteria and increased LPS-containing gut microbiota which further leads to obesity, the main risk factor for CVDs. Importantly, continuous subcutaneous infusion of LPS showed a tendency to cause the change of glucose metabolism and the pattern of weight gain was similar to that seen when taking a high-fat diet. Therefore, intestinal dysbiosis and the corresponding change in metabolites lead to abnormal nutrient metabolism, insulin resistance, and increased adipose tissue storage, which increases the risk of cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity and diabetes.

"Scientific evidence indicates that the metabolic status of microbiota exerts a more important role than the equilibrium between bacterial species. Microbial metabolites can act as positive modulators of the gut-brain-axis constituents, boosting the immune cells and exerting a positive/protective effect on neurodegenerative disease progression. On the other hand, disrupted equilibrium between microbial species often leads to specific switches in the microbial metabolome, which may be harmful and associated with neurodegenerative disease progression. For example, dysregulation of Gram-negative bacteria in the gastrointestinal area leads to the production of harmful metabolites (i.e., endo- and exotoxins, saccharides, and amyloids). Exotoxins, such as LPS, which have the ability to activate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, exert negative effects. LPS belongs to glycolipid molecules, mostly produced by Gram-negative bacterial strains. These molecules participate in the integrity maintenance of the bacterial outer-membrane permeability barrier, playing an important role in host-pathogen interplay. The overproduction of bacterial LPS can cause the activation of the macrophage-monocyte nod-like receptor P3 inflammasome, therefore stimulating the production of cytokines with pro-inflammatory activity, such as IL-18 or IL-1beta.

"The health of the gut microbiome can vary depending on various factors including diet (e.g., ingestion of saturated/unsaturated dietary fats, vitamins, minerals, dairy products, alcoholic beverages, polyphenols containing food such as cocoa-rich chocolate, tea, or coffee), dietary patterns, geographical area, and diet-related habits (sometimes varying between males and females) and sex (the influence of sex hormones). A positive correlation between polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (N-3 PUFA), and alpha-linolenic acid (aLNA) ingestion and protection against PD development in dose-response trends was demonstrated. American studies demonstrated that PUFA replacement with increased animal fat intake (Western Diet) significantly increased the risk of PD in males only. Excessive animal fat intake can promote dysbiosis and the production of harmful microbial metabolites, which can increase the prevalence of the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, sex differences are implicated in the mental health and prevalence of psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, and neurodegenerative disorders.

One of the main signs of ALS is the accumulation of phosphorylated protein, which binds to DNA in the form of protein aggregates deposited in glia and motor neurons. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) methods, such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing, have demonstrated the alteration of numerous bacteria, including Parabacteroides distasonis, Lactobacillus gasseri, Prevotella melaninogenica, Ruminococcus torques, and Akkermansia muciniphila. Changes in bacterial abundance and diversity correlate with ASL origins (as one of the environmental factors) together with impaired metabolism, immunological functions, and toxin accumulation, leading to brain damage. It has been demonstrated that Akkermansia muciniphila alleviates ALS symptoms, although Ruminococcus torques and Parabacteroides distasonis aggravate them. The main switches have been observed in SCFA-producing bacteria, leading to reduced levels of SCFAs, e.g., butyrate and propionate.",16209248.0,1357,KTCM--11eR,Parabacteroides distasonis,1013.0,1039.0,Species,965.0,968.0,ALS,Disease,complicates
"Scientific evidence indicates that the metabolic status of microbiota exerts a more important role than the equilibrium between bacterial species. Microbial metabolites can act as positive modulators of the gut-brain-axis constituents, boosting the immune cells and exerting a positive/protective effect on neurodegenerative disease progression. On the other hand, disrupted equilibrium between microbial species often leads to specific switches in the microbial metabolome, which may be harmful and associated with neurodegenerative disease progression. For example, dysregulation of Gram-negative bacteria in the gastrointestinal area leads to the production of harmful metabolites (i.e., endo- and exotoxins, saccharides, and amyloids). Exotoxins, such as LPS, which have the ability to activate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, exert negative effects. LPS belongs to glycolipid molecules, mostly produced by Gram-negative bacterial strains. These molecules participate in the integrity maintenance of the bacterial outer-membrane permeability barrier, playing an important role in host-pathogen interplay. The overproduction of bacterial LPS can cause the activation of the macrophage-monocyte nod-like receptor P3 inflammasome, therefore stimulating the production of cytokines with pro-inflammatory activity, such as IL-18 or IL-1beta. LPS can be translocated and intensify neuroinflammatory diseases such as AD. Additionally, it was demonstrated that IL-1beta can decrease the phagocytic function of microglial cells, stimulating the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, and causing reduced synaptic plasticity and cognitive deterioration. These cytokines can induce microbiota dysregulation, increasing gut permeability and influencing gut bacteria diversity.",16508033.0,PB7E0T4J9a,DJguo04S8v,Gram-negative bacteria,585.0,607.0,Species,691.0,710.0,endo- and exotoxins,Chemical,increase
"Aromatic amino acids including tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine are metabolized into indole and phenols by certain intestinal anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, and Peptostreptococcus. Tryptophan is decomposed into indole, indoleacetic acid, indole-3-lactic acid, 3-methylindole (skatole) and other indole compounds under the action of tryptophanase. Tryptophanase is the key enzyme that generates indole. The activity of the enzyme is easily induced by the substrate tryptophan, so when the amount of tryptophan changes in the colonic environment, the content of indole will fluctuate greatly. Of note, the metabolic products of aromatic amino acids generated by gut microbiota have a great impact on the pathology of cardiometabolic diseases. For example, indole propionic acid is associated with insulin sensitivity and appears to reduce the risk of diabetes. Moreover, the gut microbiota metabolizes dietary tryptophan to indoxyl, which further generates indoxyl sulfate through sulfonation. Excessive accumulation of indoxyl sulfate causes cardiomyocyte damage and increases thrombus formation. Another phenol compound, 4-methylphenol, can inhibit the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into mature adipocytes, induce apoptosis and reduce glucose uptake. In addition, benzoic acid is an aromatic carboxylic acid synthesized by colonic microorganisms by metabolizing dietary aromatic compounds. Plasma benzoic acid levels were found to be elevated in the rat model of polygenic diabetes.",17445219.0,1045,1044,indole,275.0,281.0,Chemical,245.0,255.0,Tryptophan,Chemical,Physically_related_to

More importantly, studies indicated that some types of microbes could be regarded as biomarkers for metabolism-related CVDs. For example, it has been reported that Dorea formicigenerans, Dorea longicatena and Collinsella aerofaciens are associated with obesity, and Lachnospiraceae is associated with lipid cardiovascular risk factors. Besides, Anaeroplasma and Haemophilus are negatively associated with cholesterol and triglycerides and positively associated with HDL.

Bacteroidetes are detected in children genetically predisposed to type 1 diabetes (T1D). Regarding T2D, patients were characterized by a decrease in several butyrate-producing bacteria and an increase in many opportunistic pathogens. For example, patients with T2D have reduced Clostridium butyricum in the gut, a main butyrate-producing bacteria. Lower concentrations of butyrate producing microbiota have been observed in fecal samples of patients with T2D. Moreover, Lactobacillus is positively correlated with fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels, while Clostridium is negatively correlated with fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels. Patients with T2D have significantly higher levels of Lactobacillus in fecal samples than healthy individuals.

"Recent evidence has demonstrated the importance of the gut microbiota in the formation and development of the immune system. The gut microbiota has profound effects on the formation of lymphoid tissue and the development of the immune system. It stimulates the development of intestinal-associated lymphoid tissues, activates lymphocytes, and regulates the production of immunoglobulin A to defend against pathogens. The structural components of gut microbiota such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), flagella, and peptidoglycan, can interact with receptors on human cells to stimulate and guide the host immune response. For instance, LPS binds to Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, flagella binds to TLR5, and peptidoglycan binds to TLR2, triggering the expression of a large number of downstream inflammatory factors, thereby affecting the cardiovascular system. Specially, LPS can interact with different receptors to induce inflammation and immune responses to increase intestinal permeability and CVDs susceptibility (Fig. 1).",16622924.0,iUvf2uhQJd,BpWmTOyWQn,peptidoglycan,509.0,522.0,Chemical,864.0,867.0,LPS,Chemical,None
"The analysis of the intestinal microbiome of adolescent and adult ADHD patients (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) indicated changes and imbalances in the gut microbiota followed by elevated levels of Bifidobacterium and Eggerthella genera related to boosted dopamine precursor formation and connected with ADHD development.

The Bifidobacterium genus plays an important role in dopamine precursor production (cyclohexadienyl dehydratase) in ADHD patients. Jiang et al. reported a reduction of Faecalibacterium spp. in paediatric patients diagnosed with ADHD and they suggested Faecalibacterium as a new marker of ADHD. Faecalibacterium depletion was followed by increased cytokine levels and inflammation. Interestingly, three bacterial species (Bacteroides uniformis, Bacteroides ovatus, and Sutterella stercoricanis) were identified as potential biomarkers of ADHD.

"Experimental research confirms the hypothesis regarding SCFA reduction in autoimmune diseases (MS among others) and altered gut microbiota. A low level of SCFAs dysregulates Treg cell functions, leading to insufficient immune tolerance towards endogenous components and enteric microbiota. However, this process can be reversed by SCFAs supplementation (e.g., propionic acid). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing NFkappaB activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation and on microglial cells in vitro. TUDCA binds to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) expressed in microglial cells. This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS). Experimental results demonstrated that TUDCA acted as a double-edged sword, triggering microglia enhancement in anti-inflammatory and alternatively activated markers and on the other hand reducing the infiltration of macrophages and microglia with expressed pro-inflammatory markers. Interestingly, during neuroinflammation, microglial cells change their morphology, converting themselves into reactive macrophage-like forms. However, microglial cells are flexible, as they can sometimes polarize towards alternatively activated phenotypes, promoting CNS pathologies (proinflammatory or M1 microglia), or exert anti-inflammatory effects, boosting cell repair and remodeling. Bile acids were identified as nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor agonists, leading to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) depletion (in a mouse model) and neuroinflammatory process adjustment. The administration of the complex probiotic positively influenced the intestinal flora balance in patients diagnosed with MS. The probiotic prevented the onset of dysbiosis, significantly increasing the amount of Methanobrevibacter and Akkermansia, Prevotella, and Sutterella in MS patients, influencing gene expression and the production of beneficial bacterial metabolites.",16224291.0,1284,9SUM-GtJ_K,Bile acids,2266.0,2276.0,Chemical,2406.0,2409.0,EAE,Disease,causes
"Recently, bacterial strains producing SCFAs have gained extreme popularity. SCFAs are small organic monocarboxylic acids, released after the fermentation of indigestible alimentary fiber (mainly galacto- or fructooligosaccharides), plant-derived polysaccharides, or the metabolism of amino acids, and are considered a key gut-derived metabolites with beneficial health effects and as essential in gut-brain crosstalk. The type of formed SCFAs is correlated with the kind of fiber ingested and the overall gut microbiota population. For example, microbes belonging to Firmicutes phyla (e.g., Lachnospiraceae, Eubacterium, or Roseburia belonging to the Clostridia class) are responsible for the main production of butyrate, whereas Bifidobacteria spp. produce lactate and acetate. SCFAs are significantly reduced during dysbiosis, where disrupted gut epithelial integrity, inflammation, and altered microbiome metabolic processes occur. In a healthy colon, levels of SCFAs can vary depending on a diet; however, in multiple diseases, these levels are altered. SCFAs may also act in an indirect or direct way through G-protein-coupled receptors or as histone deacetylase epigenetic modulators. They participate in various physiological processes, such as cell energetics and colonocyte metabolism and skeletal, adipose, and liver tissue modulation. Their major functions comprise the activation of trophic factors, energy management, and the manufacturing of regulatory T-cells.

"Besides the propagation of an inflammatory state, microbial endotoxins are probably involved in AD's inflammatory amyloidosis. Metagenomics analysis showed that patients suffering from cognitive dysfunctions related to amyloidosis demonstrated elevated amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neurotoxic compounds. In these patients, increased inflammation was probably related to Eubacterium deficiency, and an overabundance of gram-negative Escherichia and Shigella species, which are known amyloid producers. They manufacture ""curli"" amyloid fibers, accumulated extracellularly through an elaborated system. Further studies revealed that the overproduction of Abeta plaques is correlated with excessive growth of Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycobacterium and Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus spp.. Galloway et al. found Abeta in small intestine epithelial cells, suggesting that gut-derived amyloids could be absorbed and finally reach systemic circulation, where they can act as pro-inflammatory factors and trigger fibrillogenesis. Additionally, it was shown that amyloids generated by microbes can influence IL-17A and IL-22 proinflammatory cytokines production, considered as a key players in NFkappaB signaling, both associated with AD and capable of crossing the BBB and GI tract.",16171393.0,711,708,Abeta,665.0,670.0,Species,808.0,829.0,Staphylococcus aureus,Species,increase

"Several studies have suggested that different BAs profiles are closely related to obesity.

"However host-microbiota interplay is not exclusively restricted to cell-cell interactions. Intestinal microbes are capable of producing a plethora of different types of compounds, i.e., small molecules (amino acids, neurotransmitters, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and other fatty acid derivatives, indoles, vitamins, and cofactors), polysaccharides, and proteins (i.e., bacteriocins), which have been reported as important factors in shaping the bacterial community and modulation of the immune system. It has been demonstrated that intestinal bacterial strains such as Escherichia coli or Lactobacillus spp. interact directly with the host's CNS (central nervous system), as they can release neurotransmitters such as dopamine, noradrenaline, histamine, acetylcholine, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), or serotonin.

"The origins of Parkinson's disease are the result of many factors such as increased age, polygenic factors (disease-segregating mutations in alpha-synuclein protein occurring in 15% of PD patients), toxins, and infectious agents. In 2006, Braak et al. assumed the gut-related origins of Parkinson's disease. One of the key pathological hallmarks of PD is Lewy bodies, being eosinophilic inclusion forms of misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates. Importantly, alpha-synuclein protein has a tendency to misfold and form aggregates. Its accumulation has been detected during bacterial and viral infections in the gut. Moreover, it can be recognized as a characteristic indicator of PD neural degeneration. This protein aggregate can boost the local immune response. Interestingly, alpha-synuclein deposition has been confirmed in the neurons of the intestinal submucosa, together with a possibility of the alpha-synuclein transport to the brain via the vagus nerve (translocation of prion-like proteins). Misfolded alpha-synuclein triggers neuronal dysfunction and progressive degeneration, thereby enabling disease progression.

"Scientific evidence indicates that the metabolic status of microbiota exerts a more important role than the equilibrium between bacterial species. Microbial metabolites can act as positive modulators of the gut-brain-axis constituents, boosting the immune cells and exerting a positive/protective effect on neurodegenerative disease progression. On the other hand, disrupted equilibrium between microbial species often leads to specific switches in the microbial metabolome, which may be harmful and associated with neurodegenerative disease progression.

"Previous results have indicated that the metabolic regulation of BAs may be associated with T2D but the specific changes in BAs and the related mechanisms remain to be studied.

A study also suggested that patients with T2D had no change in plasma total BAs, but had an increase in DCA and a decrease in CDCA in plasma. Another study found that the plasma total BA concentration in patients with T2D was not significantly different from that of healthy people; however, the concentration of DCA in the plasma of patients with T2D was significantly higher than that of healthy controls. The mechanism may be that FXR and TGR5 are inhibited during insulin resistance, and the most effective natural ligands of the receptors, DCA and CA, are compensatorily increased. Besides, circulating BAs levels including DCA, TCA, TDCA, and glycodeoxycholic acid, are positively associated with the risk of T2D, while taurohyodeoxycholic acid is negatively associated with diabetes.

They showed that higher fecal SCFAs levels with less efficient SCFAs absorption into blood were associated with obesity and cardiometabolic dysregulation.

"Mechanically, current studies suggest that SCFAs may exert their functions through acting as energy substrates and maintaining metabolic integration by a variety of different downstream regulatory mechanisms, such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPRs) with GPR41/Recombinant Free Fatty Acid Receptor (FFAR3), GPR43/FFAR2, GPR109A, Olfactory Receptors 78 (Olfr78) in endocrine cells of the gut wall, as well as histone deacetylases (HDACs) (Fig. 2). GPR41 regulates host energy acquisition and promotes the catabolism of glucose and lipids. The decreased SCFAs may cause less activated GPR41 and higher levels of energy uptake. In addition, it has also been reported that the lower production of SCFAs in gut microbiota would increase the host's capability of obtaining energy from the diet. SCFAs from bacterial fermentation promote the secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY) through GPR43 and GPR41 from intestinal L cells. GLP-1 increased pancreatic insulin secretion, and inhibited the production of glucagon.

"Previous results have indicated that the metabolic regulation of BAs may be associated with T2D but the specific changes in BAs and the related mechanisms remain to be studied. It is also unclear how the different types of BAs change in patients with T2D. A study also suggested that patients with T2D had no change in plasma total BAs, but had an increase in DCA and a decrease in CDCA in plasma. Another study found that the plasma total BA concentration in patients with T2D was not significantly different from that of healthy people; however, the concentration of DCA in the plasma of patients with T2D was significantly higher than that of healthy controls. The mechanism may be that FXR and TGR5 are inhibited during insulin resistance, and the most effective natural ligands of the receptors, DCA and CA, are compensatorily increased. Besides, circulating BAs levels including DCA, TCA, TDCA, and glycodeoxycholic acid, are positively associated with the risk of T2D, while taurohyodeoxycholic acid is negatively associated with diabetes. This may be due to the fact that hydrophobic BAs isoforms (such as DCA) have been shown to be involved in inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress with glucose dysregulation, and hydrophilic BAs isoforms (such as tauroursodeoxycholic acid) have been shown to prevent inflammation and enhance insulin sensitivity.",18340523.0,bEy-orNMhi,2044,insulin resistance,724.0,742.0,Disease,690.0,693.0,FXR,Species,decrease

Butyrate could promote the secretion of postprandial insulin; and the increase in fecal propionic acid was associated with an increase in T2D risk. In oral glucose tolerance test, a high butyrate-producing microbiota was associated with an improved insulin response (indicating improved beta-cell function), and butyrate concentration was directly related to postprandial insulin sensitivity.

"Aromatic amino acids including tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine are metabolized into indole and phenols by certain intestinal anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, and Peptostreptococcus. Tryptophan is decomposed into indole, indoleacetic acid, indole-3-lactic acid, 3-methylindole (skatole) and other indole compounds under the action of tryptophanase. Tryptophanase is the key enzyme that generates indole. The activity of the enzyme is easily induced by the substrate tryptophan, so when the amount of tryptophan changes in the colonic environment, the content of indole will fluctuate greatly. Of note, the metabolic products of aromatic amino acids generated by gut microbiota have a great impact on the pathology of cardiometabolic diseases. For example, indole propionic acid is associated with insulin sensitivity and appears to reduce the risk of diabetes. Moreover, the gut microbiota metabolizes dietary tryptophan to indoxyl, which further generates indoxyl sulfate through sulfonation. Excessive accumulation of indoxyl sulfate causes cardiomyocyte damage and increases thrombus formation. Another phenol compound, 4-methylphenol, can inhibit the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into mature adipocytes, induce apoptosis and reduce glucose uptake.

"Scientific evidence indicates that the metabolic status of microbiota exerts a more important role than the equilibrium between bacterial species. Microbial metabolites can act as positive modulators of the gut-brain-axis constituents, boosting the immune cells and exerting a positive/protective effect on neurodegenerative disease progression. On the other hand, disrupted equilibrium between microbial species often leads to specific switches in the microbial metabolome, which may be harmful and associated with neurodegenerative disease progression. For example, dysregulation of Gram-negative bacteria in the gastrointestinal area leads to the production of harmful metabolites (i.e., endo- and exotoxins, saccharides, and amyloids). Exotoxins, such as LPS, which have the ability to activate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, exert negative effects. LPS belongs to glycolipid molecules, mostly produced by Gram-negative bacterial strains. These molecules participate in the integrity maintenance of the bacterial outer-membrane permeability barrier, playing an important role in host-pathogen interplay. The overproduction of bacterial LPS can cause the activation of the macrophage-monocyte nod-like receptor P3 inflammasome, therefore stimulating the production of cytokines with pro-inflammatory activity, such as IL-18 or IL-1beta. LPS can be translocated and intensify neuroinflammatory diseases such as AD. Additionally, it was demonstrated that IL-1beta can decrease the phagocytic function of microglial cells, stimulating the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, and causing reduced synaptic plasticity and cognitive deterioration.

"The origins of Parkinson's disease are the result of many factors such as increased age, polygenic factors (disease-segregating mutations in alpha-synuclein protein occurring in 15% of PD patients), toxins, and infectious agents. In 2006, Braak et al. assumed the gut-related origins of Parkinson's disease. One of the key pathological hallmarks of PD is Lewy bodies, being eosinophilic inclusion forms of misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates. Importantly, alpha-synuclein protein has a tendency to misfold and form aggregates. Its accumulation has been detected during bacterial and viral infections in the gut. Moreover, it can be recognized as a characteristic indicator of PD neural degeneration. This protein aggregate can boost the local immune response. Interestingly, alpha-synuclein deposition has been confirmed in the neurons of the intestinal submucosa, together with a possibility of the alpha-synuclein transport to the brain via the vagus nerve (translocation of prion-like proteins). Misfolded alpha-synuclein triggers neuronal dysfunction and progressive degeneration, thereby enabling disease progression. Additionally, alpha-synuclein deposition in CNS is associated with intestinal hyperpermeability, TLRs, and pro-inflammatory cytokine overexpression.

"The gut microbiome is crucially engaged in the regulation and maintenance of human health and homeostasis, i.e., proper intestine motion, fibre digestion, regulating the development of host immunity, and exerting a protective effect against pathogenic factors (such as Campylobacter jejuni, Helicobacter pylori, and Clostridium difficile).

"Experimental research confirms the hypothesis regarding SCFA reduction in autoimmune diseases (MS among others) and altered gut microbiota. A low level of SCFAs dysregulates Treg cell functions, leading to insufficient immune tolerance towards endogenous components and enteric microbiota. However, this process can be reversed by SCFAs supplementation (e.g., propionic acid). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing NFkappaB activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation and on microglial cells in vitro. TUDCA binds to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) expressed in microglial cells. This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS). Experimental results demonstrated that TUDCA acted as a double-edged sword, triggering microglia enhancement in anti-inflammatory and alternatively activated markers and on the other hand reducing the infiltration of macrophages and microglia with expressed pro-inflammatory markers. Interestingly, during neuroinflammation, microglial cells change their morphology, converting themselves into reactive macrophage-like forms. However, microglial cells are flexible, as they can sometimes polarize towards alternatively activated phenotypes, promoting CNS pathologies (proinflammatory or M1 microglia), or exert anti-inflammatory effects, boosting cell repair and remodeling. Bile acids were identified as nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor agonists, leading to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) depletion (in a mouse model) and neuroinflammatory process adjustment. The administration of the complex probiotic positively influenced the intestinal flora balance in patients diagnosed with MS. The probiotic prevented the onset of dysbiosis, significantly increasing the amount of Methanobrevibacter and Akkermansia, Prevotella, and Sutterella in MS patients, influencing gene expression and the production of beneficial bacterial metabolites.",16224291.0,1291,0YDTTIhlIG,patients,2580.0,2588.0,Species,2604.0,2606.0,MS,Disease,experiences
"Recently, bacterial strains producing SCFAs have gained extreme popularity. SCFAs are small organic monocarboxylic acids, released after the fermentation of indigestible alimentary fiber (mainly galacto- or fructooligosaccharides), plant-derived polysaccharides, or the metabolism of amino acids, and are considered a key gut-derived metabolites with beneficial health effects and as essential in gut-brain crosstalk. The type of formed SCFAs is correlated with the kind of fiber ingested and the overall gut microbiota population. For example, microbes belonging to Firmicutes phyla (e.g., Lachnospiraceae, Eubacterium, or Roseburia belonging to the Clostridia class) are responsible for the main production of butyrate, whereas Bifidobacteria spp. produce lactate and acetate. SCFAs are significantly reduced during dysbiosis, where disrupted gut epithelial integrity, inflammation, and altered microbiome metabolic processes occur. In a healthy colon, levels of SCFAs can vary depending on a diet; however, in multiple diseases, these levels are altered. SCFAs may also act in an indirect or direct way through G-protein-coupled receptors or as histone deacetylase epigenetic modulators. They participate in various physiological processes, such as cell energetics and colonocyte metabolism and skeletal, adipose, and liver tissue modulation. Their major functions comprise the activation of trophic factors, energy management, and the manufacturing of regulatory T-cells.

"The gut microbial community is the largest micro-ecosystem in the human body, formed by more than 1000 different species, with high density per mL and encoding approximately 4 x 106 genes, 150 times more unique than the human genome. It is predicted that the total weight of our gut microbiota deposit circulates around 1-2 kg, approximately reaching the human brain weight. Ninety-five percent of symbiotic microorganisms are located in the gut. These multi-species ecological arrangements mostly comprise anaerobic bacteria, with at least 500-1000 different species and more than 7000 strains, mainly from the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes families (accounting for approx. 90% of bacterial species). In addition, the gut microbiome is co-inhabited by bacteria belonging to Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia phyla, as well as archaea, viruses, fungi, bacteriophages, and protozoa (especially during pathologic conditions), which reside in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, maintaining symbiosis with the host.",16114793.0,DG7rnA8m29,cKd-ghRBJv,Verrucomicrobia phyla,810.0,831.0,Species,961.0,988.0,gastrointestinal (GI) tract,Cellline,Location_of
"The function of the gut microbiota is closely related to the risk of CVDs. Specifically, an impaired mucosal barrier, overactivated inflammation, and immune dysfunction are crucial steps in the development of CVDs triggered by gut microbiota dysbiosis. The structural constituents of gram-negative bacteria, such as LPS, are the main reason for endotoxemia and impaired intestinal mucosal barrier function. It has been reported that LPS is important in the development of cardiometabolic diseases. Moreover, studies showed that the high-fat diet could result in decreased intestinal levels of gram-positive Bifidobacteria and increased LPS-containing gut microbiota which further leads to obesity, the main risk factor for CVDs. Importantly, continuous subcutaneous infusion of LPS showed a tendency to cause the change of glucose metabolism and the pattern of weight gain was similar to that seen when taking a high-fat diet. Therefore, intestinal dysbiosis and the corresponding change in metabolites lead to abnormal nutrient metabolism, insulin resistance, and increased adipose tissue storage, which increases the risk of cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity and diabetes. Herein, we take obesity and diabetes as examples to explain the effect of gut microbiota on cardiovascular risk factors (Fig. 3).",18057704.0,5eO7H-Hnx7,1307,increased adipose tissue,1065.0,1089.0,Disease,1163.0,1170.0,obesity,Disease,increase

"However host-microbiota interplay is not exclusively restricted to cell-cell interactions. Intestinal microbes are capable of producing a plethora of different types of compounds, i.e., small molecules (amino acids, neurotransmitters, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and other fatty acid derivatives, indoles, vitamins, and cofactors), polysaccharides, and proteins (i.e., bacteriocins), which have been reported as important factors in shaping the bacterial community and modulation of the immune system. It has been demonstrated that intestinal bacterial strains such as Escherichia coli or Lactobacillus spp. interact directly with the host's CNS (central nervous system), as they can release neurotransmitters such as dopamine, noradrenaline, histamine, acetylcholine, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), or serotonin. This metabolic status of the microbiome is also vulnerable to dysbiosis and compositional changes and often leads to metabolic disturbances. For example, dysbiosis can induce elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, intensifying oxidative stress and neuronal inflammatory processes. It has been estimated that 40% of the metabolites detected in humans are the products of bacterial metabolism, which plays a fundamental role in the modulation of the host's physiological processes, including immune-mediated neurodegeneration or affecting neural cell metabolism.",16115776.0,129,jkPLcUvxai,Lactobacillus,593.0,606.0,Species,651.0,673.0,central nervous system,Cellline,Interacts_with

"BAs, as by-products of cholesterol metabolism, are the main organic component of bile and are synthesized in hepatocytes. Cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) are primary BAs directly synthesized from cholesterol; secondary BAs include deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholic acid (LCA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and their glycine and taurine conjugated forms. BAs are excreted into the intestine to aid in the digestion and absorption of lipids and combine with farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and takeda-G-protein receptor 5 (TGR5) (Fig. 2). There is a strong biochemical relationship between BAs and gut microbiota. Some gut microbiota in healthy people can convert conjugated BAs into free BAs, and can transform BAs into secondary BAs with the help of bile salt hydrolase (BSH) and cholesterol 7-alpha hydroxy-lase (CYP7A1), so as to reduce blood cholesterol by affecting the enterohepatic circulation of BAs. Besides, the gut microbiota affects the metabolism of BAs by regulating the activity of BSH to reduce LDL cholesterol levels. BAs have bacteriostatic properties and an antimicrobial effect. BAs destroy the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane and thereby change the intestinal microecology. BAs also prevent bacteria from overgrowth and decrease inflammation. More importantly, BAs are also closely associated with CVDs. For example, BAs levels in the feces of patients with CVDs are different from those in healthy individuals. And BAs have been reported to regulate vascular tension and affect ion exchange on cardiomyocyte membranes, suggesting that regulating BAs by gut microbiota might be a treatment for CVDs.",17301489.0,859,u1T3OekUCN,DCA,267.0,270.0,Chemical,227.0,240.0,secondary BAs,Chemical,part_of
"Importantly, studies found that the occurrence of CVDs was also involved in the immune response mediated by the NLR family. For example, atherosclerotic plaques in LDLR-/- NOD 1/2-/- mice showed less lipid deposition and macrophage aggregation, suggesting that lack of NOD 1/2 may reduce the occurrence of atherosclerosis. Moreover, the peptidoglycan components in bacteria can bind to NOD1 and NOD2, which in turn mediate the occurrence of the inflammatory response, and further leads to atherosclerosis. Besides, inflammation induced by the NLRP3 inflammasome plays a role in the interaction between gut microbiota and cardiometabolic diseases. For instance, the NLRP3 deficient obese mice had altered composition of the gut microbiota, decreased TMAO and LPS levels, as well as downregulated hepatic steatosis and myocardial energy metabolism. Nevertheless, another study reported that NOD TLR4 -/- mice developed higher body weight, hyperlipidemia, severe insulin, and glucose intolerance, lower circulating SCFAs levels, higher levels of Bacteroidetes, lower levels of Firmicutes in the large intestine, as well as fewer SCFAs-associated gut microbiota, all of which may promote the development of insulin-deficient diabetes.",16855003.0,gXNbbggXwN,YgISsWEy5W,NLRP3 deficient obese,665.0,686.0,Disease,758.0,761.0,LPS,Chemical,decrease
"The bacteria living in the human gut are also called commensals. Some beneficial commensal microbes could repair the normal function of the intestinal barrier and exert anti-inflammatory effects, such as Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila), Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Roseburia intestinalis, et al. . These commensal microbes make up about 20% of the total gut microbiota. They are indispensable for maintaining the physiological function of adult tissues and organs by synthesizing a variety of vitamins, participating in food digestion, producing lactic acid, promoting intestinal peristalsis, inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microbiota, and activating the immune system. For example, one of the most important commensal microbes in the human gut is Bifidobacterium, a strictly anaerobic gram-positive bacterium, which assists the human body in the digestion and absorption of nutrients, resists the invasion of harmful bacteria, improves the immune function of the body, secretes molecules to regulate immune function, and participates in the metabolism of substances in the intestine. Besides, another common commensal microbe, A. muciniphila, a gram-positive bacterium, reduces insulin sensitivity and is inversely associated with the development of obesity and diabetes.

"The origins of Parkinson's disease are the result of many factors such as increased age, polygenic factors (disease-segregating mutations in alpha-synuclein protein occurring in 15% of PD patients), toxins, and infectious agents. In 2006, Braak et al. assumed the gut-related origins of Parkinson's disease. One of the key pathological hallmarks of PD is Lewy bodies, being eosinophilic inclusion forms of misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates. Importantly, alpha-synuclein protein has a tendency to misfold and form aggregates. Its accumulation has been detected during bacterial and viral infections in the gut. Moreover, it can be recognized as a characteristic indicator of PD neural degeneration. This protein aggregate can boost the local immune response. Interestingly, alpha-synuclein deposition has been confirmed in the neurons of the intestinal submucosa, together with a possibility of the alpha-synuclein transport to the brain via the vagus nerve (translocation of prion-like proteins). Misfolded alpha-synuclein triggers neuronal dysfunction and progressive degeneration, thereby enabling disease progression.

"Additionally, it has been reported that the intestinal microbiota plays a very crucial role in the neuroendocrine system, which is correlated to the gut-brain axis. As the major neuroendocrine system, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulates various pathophysiological processes in response to inside and outside stressors. It is increasingly recognized that the establishment of intestinal microbiota in early life can impact the development as well as the function of nervous system, especially regulating neuroendocrine function. In neonatal germ-free mice, colonization with B. infantis, and Bifidobacterium could attenuate the high sensitivity of the HPA axis and establish functional neural circuits. The imbalanced microbiota may fail to execute metabolic functions, brain function and neuromodulators. The regulation of neurohumoral-immune not only promotes the development of neurological diseases, but also promotes the occurrence and development of CVDs via the HPA axis and renin-angiotensin system (RAS).

"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal health condition caused by the progressive neural death of the spinal cord, brain stem, and motor cortex neurons, causing advanced weakness, paralysis, eating difficulties, and respiratory failure. One of the main signs of ALS is the accumulation of phosphorylated protein, which binds to DNA in the form of protein aggregates deposited in glia and motor neurons. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) methods, such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing, have demonstrated the alteration of numerous bacteria, including Parabacteroides distasonis, Lactobacillus gasseri, Prevotella melaninogenica, Ruminococcus torques, and Akkermansia muciniphila. Changes in bacterial abundance and diversity correlate with ASL origins (as one of the environmental factors) together with impaired metabolism, immunological functions, and toxin accumulation, leading to brain damage. It has been demonstrated that Akkermansia muciniphila alleviates ALS symptoms, although Ruminococcus torques and Parabacteroides distasonis aggravate them.

"The bacteria living in the human gut are also called commensals. Some beneficial commensal microbes could repair the normal function of the intestinal barrier and exert anti-inflammatory effects, such as Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila), Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Roseburia intestinalis, et al. . These commensal microbes make up about 20% of the total gut microbiota. They are indispensable for maintaining the physiological function of adult tissues and organs by synthesizing a variety of vitamins, participating in food digestion, producing lactic acid, promoting intestinal peristalsis, inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microbiota, and activating the immune system. For example, one of the most important commensal microbes in the human gut is Bifidobacterium, a strictly anaerobic gram-positive bacterium, which assists the human body in the digestion and absorption of nutrients, resists the invasion of harmful bacteria, improves the immune function of the body, secretes molecules to regulate immune function, and participates in the metabolism of substances in the intestine. Besides, another common commensal microbe, A. muciniphila, a gram-positive bacterium, reduces insulin sensitivity and is inversely associated with the development of obesity and diabetes.

"Particularly, SCFAs also have anti-inflammatory functions. It was reported that the butyrate and propionate can inhibit the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and NF-kappaB signaling pathways. These may be because that SCFAs can inhibit the activity of HDAC, inactivate the NF-kappaB pathway and decrease the expression of interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-6, and TNF-alpha, which further control inflammation. Meanwhile, butyrate increases the acetylation of H3 histone in the Forkhead box protein P3 (FOXP3) promoter by inhibiting HDAC4, thus promoting Treg differentiation, affecting G1-phase-specific cyclins, and further resulting in the markedly inhibited proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, thereby inhibiting myocardial fibrosis and improving heart function.",17066164.0,766,757,TNF-alpha,348.0,357.0,Gene,381.0,393.0,inflammation,Disease,causes

"Importantly, studies found that the occurrence of CVDs was also involved in the immune response mediated by the NLR family. For example, atherosclerotic plaques in LDLR-/- NOD 1/2-/- mice showed less lipid deposition and macrophage aggregation, suggesting that lack of NOD 1/2 may reduce the occurrence of atherosclerosis. Moreover, the peptidoglycan components in bacteria can bind to NOD1 and NOD2, which in turn mediate the occurrence of the inflammatory response, and further leads to atherosclerosis. Besides, inflammation induced by the NLRP3 inflammasome plays a role in the interaction between gut microbiota and cardiometabolic diseases. For instance, the NLRP3 deficient obese mice had altered composition of the gut microbiota, decreased TMAO and LPS levels, as well as downregulated hepatic steatosis and myocardial energy metabolism. Nevertheless, another study reported that NOD TLR4 -/- mice developed higher body weight, hyperlipidemia, severe insulin, and glucose intolerance, lower circulating SCFAs levels, higher levels of Bacteroidetes, lower levels of Firmicutes in the large intestine, as well as fewer SCFAs-associated gut microbiota, all of which may promote the development of insulin-deficient diabetes.",16855003.0,gXNbbggXwN,379,NLRP3 deficient obese,665.0,686.0,Disease,795.0,845.0,hepatic steatosis and myocardial energy metabolism,Disease,worsen

"SCFAs may prevent obesity by regulating the homeostasis of glucose and lipid metabolism. For instance, acetate decreases appetite and nutrient intake. Propionate activates intestinal gluconeogenesis by a gut-brain neural circuit to promote energy balance. Butyrate provides energy for colon cells, maintains the integrity of intestinal walls, and improves the insulin response, which activates gluconeogenesis to maintain the balance of glucose and energy through the cAMP pathway. And one study indicated that oral butyrate intake prevents obesity and insulin resistance. Furthermore, the role of SCFAs in metabolic hemostasis is related to other factors. Adenosine monophosphate activating protein (AMPK) is a heterotrimeric enzyme that stimulates liver and muscle fatty acid oxidation pathways. SCFAs promote the activity of AMPK and improve its ability to oxidize fatty acids. Last, SCFAs can affect the development of dyslipidemia. SCFAs increase the expression of fasting-induced adipose factor (FIAF), a circulating lipoprotein lipase inhibitor, by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-gamma), thereby decreasing the activity of lipoproteinases and inhibiting lipolysis in adipose tissues.

Mice with higher levels of non-12-OH BAs gained weight slowly and had less metabolic disturbance, while the rapidly gaining weight mice had significantly lower levels of non-12-OH BAs such as UDCA. UDCA intake significantly reduced weight gain and metabolic disturbances induced by high-fat diet. Another study also provided evidence that a high-fat diet caused obesity by increasing the levels of 12-OH BAs. In a rat model, high-fat diet caused increases in the total BAs, DCA and taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA) in plasma and liver tissues, and increases in DCA in intestinal tissues and feces.

Furthermore, the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota triggers intestinal mucosal barrier damage, leading to inflammation and disordered nutrient metabolism.

"However host-microbiota interplay is not exclusively restricted to cell-cell interactions. Intestinal microbes are capable of producing a plethora of different types of compounds, i.e., small molecules (amino acids, neurotransmitters, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and other fatty acid derivatives, indoles, vitamins, and cofactors), polysaccharides, and proteins (i.e., bacteriocins), which have been reported as important factors in shaping the bacterial community and modulation of the immune system. It has been demonstrated that intestinal bacterial strains such as Escherichia coli or Lactobacillus spp. interact directly with the host's CNS (central nervous system), as they can release neurotransmitters such as dopamine, noradrenaline, histamine, acetylcholine, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), or serotonin. This metabolic status of the microbiome is also vulnerable to dysbiosis and compositional changes and often leads to metabolic disturbances. For example, dysbiosis can induce elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, intensifying oxidative stress and neuronal inflammatory processes.

"Aromatic amino acids including tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine are metabolized into indole and phenols by certain intestinal anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, and Peptostreptococcus. Tryptophan is decomposed into indole, indoleacetic acid, indole-3-lactic acid, 3-methylindole (skatole) and other indole compounds under the action of tryptophanase. Tryptophanase is the key enzyme that generates indole. The activity of the enzyme is easily induced by the substrate tryptophan, so when the amount of tryptophan changes in the colonic environment, the content of indole will fluctuate greatly. Of note, the metabolic products of aromatic amino acids generated by gut microbiota have a great impact on the pathology of cardiometabolic diseases. For example, indole propionic acid is associated with insulin sensitivity and appears to reduce the risk of diabetes. Moreover, the gut microbiota metabolizes dietary tryptophan to indoxyl, which further generates indoxyl sulfate through sulfonation. Excessive accumulation of indoxyl sulfate causes cardiomyocyte damage and increases thrombus formation. Another phenol compound, 4-methylphenol, can inhibit the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into mature adipocytes, induce apoptosis and reduce glucose uptake.

The type of formed SCFAs is correlated with the kind of fiber ingested and the overall gut microbiota population. For example, microbes belonging to Firmicutes phyla (e.g., Lachnospiraceae, Eubacterium, or Roseburia belonging to the Clostridia class) are responsible for the main production of butyrate, whereas Bifidobacteria spp. produce lactate and acetate. SCFAs are significantly reduced during dysbiosis, where disrupted gut epithelial integrity, inflammation, and altered microbiome metabolic processes occur. In a healthy colon, levels of SCFAs can vary depending on a diet; however, in multiple diseases, these levels are altered.

"Scientific evidence indicates that the metabolic status of microbiota exerts a more important role than the equilibrium between bacterial species. Microbial metabolites can act as positive modulators of the gut-brain-axis constituents, boosting the immune cells and exerting a positive/protective effect on neurodegenerative disease progression. On the other hand, disrupted equilibrium between microbial species often leads to specific switches in the microbial metabolome, which may be harmful and associated with neurodegenerative disease progression. For example, dysregulation of Gram-negative bacteria in the gastrointestinal area leads to the production of harmful metabolites (i.e., endo- and exotoxins, saccharides, and amyloids). Exotoxins, such as LPS, which have the ability to activate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, exert negative effects. LPS belongs to glycolipid molecules, mostly produced by Gram-negative bacterial strains. These molecules participate in the integrity maintenance of the bacterial outer-membrane permeability barrier, playing an important role in host-pathogen interplay. The overproduction of bacterial LPS can cause the activation of the macrophage-monocyte nod-like receptor P3 inflammasome, therefore stimulating the production of cytokines with pro-inflammatory activity, such as IL-18 or IL-1beta. LPS can be translocated and intensify neuroinflammatory diseases such as AD.

Mice fed BAs exhibited obesity and a composition change in the obesity-associated gut microbiota, which is similar to high-fat diet-fed mice. Under a high-fat diet, the concentration of intestinal BAs increases, and the composition of gut microbiota alternates. For example, the increased BAs are the main reason for the marked increase in the abundance of the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. Another study has shown that BAs and a high-fat diet promote the growth of Bilophila wadsworthia in mice, and secondary BAs produced by Bilophila spp. have been shown to induce obesity. What's more, it has been reported that the low capacity of microbiota to metabolize Tauro-beta-muricholic acid, a primary BA, might increase the risk of obesity and insulin resistance. Therefore, BAs profiles affect the composition of gut microbiota, and gut microbiota also regulates the production and ratio of different BAs to play an important role in obesity susceptibility.",18109315.0,6MUrlampaM,1615,secondary BAs,646.0,659.0,Chemical,713.0,720.0,obesity,Disease,causes
"Experimental research confirms the hypothesis regarding SCFA reduction in autoimmune diseases (MS among others) and altered gut microbiota. A low level of SCFAs dysregulates Treg cell functions, leading to insufficient immune tolerance towards endogenous components and enteric microbiota. However, this process can be reversed by SCFAs supplementation (e.g., propionic acid). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing NFkappaB activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation and on microglial cells in vitro. TUDCA binds to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) expressed in microglial cells. This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS). Experimental results demonstrated that TUDCA acted as a double-edged sword, triggering microglia enhancement in anti-inflammatory and alternatively activated markers and on the other hand reducing the infiltration of macrophages and microglia with expressed pro-inflammatory markers. Interestingly, during neuroinflammation, microglial cells change their morphology, converting themselves into reactive macrophage-like forms. However, microglial cells are flexible, as they can sometimes polarize towards alternatively activated phenotypes, promoting CNS pathologies (proinflammatory or M1 microglia), or exert anti-inflammatory effects, boosting cell repair and remodeling. Bile acids were identified as nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor agonists, leading to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) depletion (in a mouse model) and neuroinflammatory process adjustment. The administration of the complex probiotic positively influenced the intestinal flora balance in patients diagnosed with MS. The probiotic prevented the onset of dysbiosis, significantly increasing the amount of Methanobrevibacter and Akkermansia, Prevotella, and Sutterella in MS patients, influencing gene expression and the production of beneficial bacterial metabolites.",16224291.0,9SUM-GtJ_K,0bpFKF8t1l,EAE,2406.0,2409.0,Disease,1051.0,1086.0,Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5,Species,None

Screening tests identified the connection between Escherichia and Shigella bacterial species and increased systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine-related processes, reported in patients with Alzheimer's. Increased inflammatory processes and oxidative stress conditions can trigger neurodegeneration observed in people with Alzheimer's disease. The previously mentioned species belong to Gram-negative bacteria, which are capable of producing huge amounts of pro-inflammatory lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), thereby causing intestinal inflammation and gut barrier disruption. Increased gut permeability permits the transport and the systemic and brain accumulation of LPS or other bacterial toxins and the propagation of an inflammatory state.

"Multiple sclerosis is a chronic neurodegenerative autoimmune disorder, where the human immune system attacks the myelin sheath surrounding axon terminals, thereby triggering long-lasting inflammation within the CNS, abrasion formation, and demyelination of axons. Besides, afterward, it can cause autonomic and cognitive problems, motor, sensory, and visual flaws, and finally paralysis and disruption of the BBB. Various animal and human studies suggested the participation of gut microbiota in the development of MS. Animal studies on an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mice model revealed a significant reduction in Lactobacillus phyla, contributing to an impairment of the mice's immune systems. In patients diagnosed with MS, a reduction in the variety and quantity of gut bacteria was detected, confirming a moderate dysbiosis state.

"BAs, as by-products of cholesterol metabolism, are the main organic component of bile and are synthesized in hepatocytes. Cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) are primary BAs directly synthesized from cholesterol; secondary BAs include deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholic acid (LCA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and their glycine and taurine conjugated forms. BAs are excreted into the intestine to aid in the digestion and absorption of lipids and combine with farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and takeda-G-protein receptor 5 (TGR5) (Fig. 2). There is a strong biochemical relationship between BAs and gut microbiota. Some gut microbiota in healthy people can convert conjugated BAs into free BAs, and can transform BAs into secondary BAs with the help of bile salt hydrolase (BSH) and cholesterol 7-alpha hydroxy-lase (CYP7A1), so as to reduce blood cholesterol by affecting the enterohepatic circulation of BAs. Besides, the gut microbiota affects the metabolism of BAs by regulating the activity of BSH to reduce LDL cholesterol levels. BAs have bacteriostatic properties and an antimicrobial effect. BAs destroy the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane and thereby change the intestinal microecology. BAs also prevent bacteria from overgrowth and decrease inflammation. More importantly, BAs are also closely associated with CVDs. For example, BAs levels in the feces of patients with CVDs are different from those in healthy individuals. And BAs have been reported to regulate vascular tension and affect ion exchange on cardiomyocyte membranes, suggesting that regulating BAs by gut microbiota might be a treatment for CVDs.",17301489.0,860,u1T3OekUCN,lithocholic acid,273.0,289.0,Chemical,227.0,240.0,secondary BAs,Chemical,part_of

"It is well known that the balance of cholesterol is closely related to human health, and disorder of cholesterol balance leads to cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. For example, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is ingested by macrophages to form foam cells and eventually leads to atherosclerosis, while high-density lipoprotein (HDL) can promote reverse cholesterol transport and play a cardiovascular protective role.

"The health of the gut microbiome can vary depending on various factors including diet (e.g., ingestion of saturated/unsaturated dietary fats, vitamins, minerals, dairy products, alcoholic beverages, polyphenols containing food such as cocoa-rich chocolate, tea, or coffee), dietary patterns, geographical area, and diet-related habits (sometimes varying between males and females) and sex (the influence of sex hormones). A positive correlation between polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (N-3 PUFA), and alpha-linolenic acid (aLNA) ingestion and protection against PD development in dose-response trends was demonstrated. American studies demonstrated that PUFA replacement with increased animal fat intake (Western Diet) significantly increased the risk of PD in males only. Excessive animal fat intake can promote dysbiosis and the production of harmful microbial metabolites, which can increase the prevalence of the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, sex differences are implicated in the mental health and prevalence of psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, and neurodegenerative disorders. It has been demonstrated that PD patients usually have altered microbiome compositions compared with controls. Similar to AD, many sex differences in PD are correlated with the protective nature of estrogens, as they are impacted by the gut-brain axis and protect against oxidative damage, thereby supporting dopaminergic function. It has been demonstrated that at age 45, the estimated overall lifetime risk for AD is about 20% for females and 10% for males, which is followed by a disruption in the patient's gut microbiota composition.

"However host-microbiota interplay is not exclusively restricted to cell-cell interactions. Intestinal microbes are capable of producing a plethora of different types of compounds, i.e., small molecules (amino acids, neurotransmitters, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and other fatty acid derivatives, indoles, vitamins, and cofactors), polysaccharides, and proteins (i.e., bacteriocins), which have been reported as important factors in shaping the bacterial community and modulation of the immune system. It has been demonstrated that intestinal bacterial strains such as Escherichia coli or Lactobacillus spp. interact directly with the host's CNS (central nervous system), as they can release neurotransmitters such as dopamine, noradrenaline, histamine, acetylcholine, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), or serotonin. This metabolic status of the microbiome is also vulnerable to dysbiosis and compositional changes and often leads to metabolic disturbances. For example, dysbiosis can induce elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, intensifying oxidative stress and neuronal inflammatory processes.

"It is currently controversial whether supplementation with BCAAs would increase circulating BCAAs, thereby increasing the risk of diabetes. And reducing BCAAs intake promotes fat mass loss and insulin sensitivity in mice with obesity. A high BCAAs diet causes excessive feeding, mainly due to excessive appetite. Adding threonine to balance the composition of amino acids in the diet can inhibit food intake. Nevertheless, some studies have found that supplementary BCAAs, such as isoleucine and leucine, can improve insulin resistance and reduce weight to lower the risk of obesity and diabetes. The inconsistency may be due to the individual state of energy excess or energy deficiency. In terms of an excessive energy state, such as in patients with obesity or diabetes who have an impaired ability to degrade BCAAs, BCAAs and related metabolites accumulate in circulation to reduce insulin sensitivity and cause insulin resistance. In most elderly people with inadequate energy or athletes who maintain good fitness habits, BCAAs can improve the form of metabolism. In these people, BCAAs decomposition metabolism is increased by regulatory factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha coactivator (PGC-1alpha) and PPARalpha, so that BCAAs levels are maintained in a steady state, which ultimately promotes glucose intake and insulin sensitivity. This was supported by the study of Newgard, who pointed out that dietary intake of BCAAs might interact with a high-fat diet to induce abnormal metabolic phenotypes such as insulin resistance. Mice fed BCAAs alone did not develop insulin resistance. However, when mice were fed a high-fat diet supplemented with BCAAs, they developed insulin resistance. This study suggested that BCAAs only lead to insulin resistance in the presence of excess energy intake. Therefore, more studies are needed to explore the supplementation with BCAAs and insulin resistance as well as the development of cardiovascular risk factors.",19341206.0,2473,2470,patients,739.0,747.0,Species,764.0,772.0,diabetes,Disease,experiences

"The PD microbiome has a diminished variety of bacterial taxonomic groups, especially the ones associated with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects and the increase of phyla, which has toxic effects. Predominantly, the reduction was observed in the Lachnospiraceae family, including Butyrivibrio, Pseudobutyrivibrio, Coprococcus, Blautia and SCFAs-producing Prevotellaceae. The increased amount of Enterobacteriaceae is linked to the severity of postural instability and walking difficulties. Moreover, the PD microbiome is characterised by increased Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium species and decreased amount of Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae. The overgrowth of Akkermansia spp. in PD patients may be strain-specific and can be related to immune-response alterations, decreased mucus thicknesses, and increased constipation. Faecalibacterium family is a crucial player producing SCFAs and anti-inflammatory metabolites, maintaining gut health. Faecalibacterium balance disturbances can lead to impaired gut-barrier function, increasing the risk of infection with enteric pathogens and boosting alpha-synuclein formation. Similarly, the Lachnospiraceae family can produce butyrate, important for the proper function of the gut epithelium. Decreased Lachnospiraceae quantity might aggravate gut inflammation, stimulate toxin production, and damage the integrity of the gut epithelial barrier. PD patients' intestinal microflora were characterised by a diminished abundance of Lachnospiraceae, which was positively correlated with PD progress, cognitive decline, and impaired motor functions. These microbiome's compositional changes correlate well with some metabolic switches. PD microbiota show reduced SCFAs production, decreased carbohydrate fermentation, and augmented proteolytic fermentation. Chen et al. demonstrated that the SCFA level was relevant to microbiota composition changes and the clinical severity of PD. The levels of SCFAs acetate, butyrate, and propionate in fecal samples of PD patients were significantly reduced, contrary to their elevated concentration in plasma.

"Schizophrenia is a severe neuropsychological disorder affecting approximately 1% of the world's population. 16S rRNA sequencing and diversity analyses of the fecal-derived microbiota obtained from patients suffering from schizophrenia indicated lower microbiome diversity. Performed analyses revealed the abundance of Proteobacteria and decreased amount of SCFAs synthesizing bacteria from Blautia, Coprococcus, and Roseburia species. It has been reported that butyrate and other SCFAs can cross the gastrointestinal endothelium and can pass through the BBB (exploiting active membrane transporters) and inhibit histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1). Abnormal microbiota can lead to reduced levels of butyrate and can cause the elevation of HDAC1 levels in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of patients with diagnosed schizophrenia, causing altered DNA methylation, impaired synaptic plasticity and short-term memory, and the development of impaired cognitive function and social abilities.",16212573.0,1521,qTlA2ol3PI,HDAC1,733.0,738.0,Gene,837.0,860.0,altered DNA methylation,Disease,Associated_with
"Particularly, SCFAs also have anti-inflammatory functions. It was reported that the butyrate and propionate can inhibit the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and NF-kappaB signaling pathways. These may be because that SCFAs can inhibit the activity of HDAC, inactivate the NF-kappaB pathway and decrease the expression of interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-6, and TNF-alpha, which further control inflammation. Meanwhile, butyrate increases the acetylation of H3 histone in the Forkhead box protein P3 (FOXP3) promoter by inhibiting HDAC4, thus promoting Treg differentiation, affecting G1-phase-specific cyclins, and further resulting in the markedly inhibited proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, thereby inhibiting myocardial fibrosis and improving heart function.",17066164.0,754,759,butyrate,84.0,92.0,Chemical,124.0,145.0,tumor necrosis factor,Gene,decrease

"The PD microbiome has a diminished variety of bacterial taxonomic groups, especially the ones associated with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects and the increase of phyla, which has toxic effects. Predominantly, the reduction was observed in the Lachnospiraceae family, including Butyrivibrio, Pseudobutyrivibrio, Coprococcus, Blautia and SCFAs-producing Prevotellaceae. The increased amount of Enterobacteriaceae is linked to the severity of postural instability and walking difficulties. Moreover, the PD microbiome is characterised by increased Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium species and decreased amount of Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae. The overgrowth of Akkermansia spp. in PD patients may be strain-specific and can be related to immune-response alterations, decreased mucus thicknesses, and increased constipation. Faecalibacterium family is a crucial player producing SCFAs and anti-inflammatory metabolites, maintaining gut health. Faecalibacterium balance disturbances can lead to impaired gut-barrier function, increasing the risk of infection with enteric pathogens and boosting alpha-synuclein formation. Similarly, the Lachnospiraceae family can produce butyrate, important for the proper function of the gut epithelium. Decreased Lachnospiraceae quantity might aggravate gut inflammation, stimulate toxin production, and damage the integrity of the gut epithelial barrier. PD patients' intestinal microflora were characterised by a diminished abundance of Lachnospiraceae, which was positively correlated with PD progress, cognitive decline, and impaired motor functions. These microbiome's compositional changes correlate well with some metabolic switches. PD microbiota show reduced SCFAs production, decreased carbohydrate fermentation, and augmented proteolytic fermentation. Chen et al. demonstrated that the SCFA level was relevant to microbiota composition changes and the clinical severity of PD. The levels of SCFAs acetate, butyrate, and propionate in fecal samples of PD patients were significantly reduced, contrary to their elevated concentration in plasma.

"The homeostasis between the gut microbiota and the host is a major modulator of the evolution in the mammalian immune system and the maturation of immunologic tissues. In addition to barrier function, gut microbiota is closely related to health and diseases through regulating immune processes.

"The health of the gut microbiome can vary depending on various factors including diet (e.g., ingestion of saturated/unsaturated dietary fats, vitamins, minerals, dairy products, alcoholic beverages, polyphenols containing food such as cocoa-rich chocolate, tea, or coffee), dietary patterns, geographical area, and diet-related habits (sometimes varying between males and females) and sex (the influence of sex hormones). A positive correlation between polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (N-3 PUFA), and alpha-linolenic acid (aLNA) ingestion and protection against PD development in dose-response trends was demonstrated. American studies demonstrated that PUFA replacement with increased animal fat intake (Western Diet) significantly increased the risk of PD in males only. Excessive animal fat intake can promote dysbiosis and the production of harmful microbial metabolites, which can increase the prevalence of the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, sex differences are implicated in the mental health and prevalence of psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, and neurodegenerative disorders. It has been demonstrated that PD patients usually have altered microbiome compositions compared with controls. Similar to AD, many sex differences in PD are correlated with the protective nature of estrogens, as they are impacted by the gut-brain axis and protect against oxidative damage, thereby supporting dopaminergic function. It has been demonstrated that at age 45, the estimated overall lifetime risk for AD is about 20% for females and 10% for males, which is followed by a disruption in the patient's gut microbiota composition.

"The mechanism by which BCAAs induce insulin resistance is still not fully understood. The rise of BCAA levels is found to regulate glycolipid metabolism, cause insulin resistance, and increase the risk of T2D. Other animal experiments have shown that elevated BCAAs are transferred to skeletal muscle, and are interfered with lipid metabolism, which causes the accumulation of lipid metabolites and ultimately leads to skeletal muscle insulin resistance. Additionally, BCAAs are the key regulatory factor of mTORC1. It activates mTORC1 and ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (S6K1) by inducing the phosphorylation of IRS1, blocking the insulin signaling pathway, and eventually causing insulin resistance. However, 2 other studies have shown that BCAAs may exert their functions without mTORC1. One study reported that the metabolites of BCAAs, 3-hydroxy isobutyrate, could cause insulin resistance by promoting skeletal muscle sprouting. Another study reported that a diet rich in BCAAs can cause overeating, obesity, and shortened lifespan, which was not related to the mTOR signaling pathway in the liver but is mainly due to hyperphagia.",18449544.0,2350,2351,BCAAs,838.0,843.0,Chemical,845.0,866.0,3-hydroxy isobutyrate,Chemical,start
"It is currently controversial whether supplementation with BCAAs would increase circulating BCAAs, thereby increasing the risk of diabetes. And reducing BCAAs intake promotes fat mass loss and insulin sensitivity in mice with obesity. A high BCAAs diet causes excessive feeding, mainly due to excessive appetite. Adding threonine to balance the composition of amino acids in the diet can inhibit food intake. Nevertheless, some studies have found that supplementary BCAAs, such as isoleucine and leucine, can improve insulin resistance and reduce weight to lower the risk of obesity and diabetes. The inconsistency may be due to the individual state of energy excess or energy deficiency. In terms of an excessive energy state, such as in patients with obesity or diabetes who have an impaired ability to degrade BCAAs, BCAAs and related metabolites accumulate in circulation to reduce insulin sensitivity and cause insulin resistance. In most elderly people with inadequate energy or athletes who maintain good fitness habits, BCAAs can improve the form of metabolism. In these people, BCAAs decomposition metabolism is increased by regulatory factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha coactivator (PGC-1alpha) and PPARalpha, so that BCAAs levels are maintained in a steady state, which ultimately promotes glucose intake and insulin sensitivity. This was supported by the study of Newgard, who pointed out that dietary intake of BCAAs might interact with a high-fat diet to induce abnormal metabolic phenotypes such as insulin resistance. Mice fed BCAAs alone did not develop insulin resistance. However, when mice were fed a high-fat diet supplemented with BCAAs, they developed insulin resistance. This study suggested that BCAAs only lead to insulin resistance in the presence of excess energy intake. Therefore, more studies are needed to explore the supplementation with BCAAs and insulin resistance as well as the development of cardiovascular risk factors.",19341206.0,2451,2466,isoleucine,481.0,491.0,Chemical,575.0,582.0,obesity,Disease,prevents

Furthermore, the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota triggers intestinal mucosal barrier damage, leading to inflammation and disordered nutrient metabolism.

"Previous results have indicated that the metabolic regulation of BAs may be associated with T2D but the specific changes in BAs and the related mechanisms remain to be studied. It is also unclear how the different types of BAs change in patients with T2D. A study also suggested that patients with T2D had no change in plasma total BAs, but had an increase in DCA and a decrease in CDCA in plasma. Another study found that the plasma total BA concentration in patients with T2D was not significantly different from that of healthy people; however, the concentration of DCA in the plasma of patients with T2D was significantly higher than that of healthy controls. The mechanism may be that FXR and TGR5 are inhibited during insulin resistance, and the most effective natural ligands of the receptors, DCA and CA, are compensatorily increased. Besides, circulating BAs levels including DCA, TCA, TDCA, and glycodeoxycholic acid, are positively associated with the risk of T2D, while taurohyodeoxycholic acid is negatively associated with diabetes. This may be due to the fact that hydrophobic BAs isoforms (such as DCA) have been shown to be involved in inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress with glucose dysregulation, and hydrophilic BAs isoforms (such as tauroursodeoxycholic acid) have been shown to prevent inflammation and enhance insulin sensitivity.",18340523.0,2034,WXVWv_iZ6f,tauroursodeoxycholic acid,1265.0,1290.0,Chemical,1231.0,1255.0,hydrophilic BAs isoforms,Chemical,prevents

"SCFAs may prevent obesity by regulating the homeostasis of glucose and lipid metabolism. For instance, acetate decreases appetite and nutrient intake. Propionate activates intestinal gluconeogenesis by a gut-brain neural circuit to promote energy balance. Butyrate provides energy for colon cells, maintains the integrity of intestinal walls, and improves the insulin response, which activates gluconeogenesis to maintain the balance of glucose and energy through the cAMP pathway. And one study indicated that oral butyrate intake prevents obesity and insulin resistance. Furthermore, the role of SCFAs in metabolic hemostasis is related to other factors. Adenosine monophosphate activating protein (AMPK) is a heterotrimeric enzyme that stimulates liver and muscle fatty acid oxidation pathways. SCFAs promote the activity of AMPK and improve its ability to oxidize fatty acids. Last, SCFAs can affect the development of dyslipidemia. SCFAs increase the expression of fasting-induced adipose factor (FIAF), a circulating lipoprotein lipase inhibitor, by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-gamma), thereby decreasing the activity of lipoproteinases and inhibiting lipolysis in adipose tissues.

"SCFAs may prevent obesity by regulating the homeostasis of glucose and lipid metabolism. For instance, acetate decreases appetite and nutrient intake. Propionate activates intestinal gluconeogenesis by a gut-brain neural circuit to promote energy balance. Butyrate provides energy for colon cells, maintains the integrity of intestinal walls, and improves the insulin response, which activates gluconeogenesis to maintain the balance of glucose and energy through the cAMP pathway. And one study indicated that oral butyrate intake prevents obesity and insulin resistance. Furthermore, the role of SCFAs in metabolic hemostasis is related to other factors. Adenosine monophosphate activating protein (AMPK) is a heterotrimeric enzyme that stimulates liver and muscle fatty acid oxidation pathways. SCFAs promote the activity of AMPK and improve its ability to oxidize fatty acids. Last, SCFAs can affect the development of dyslipidemia. SCFAs increase the expression of fasting-induced adipose factor (FIAF), a circulating lipoprotein lipase inhibitor, by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-gamma), thereby decreasing the activity of lipoproteinases and inhibiting lipolysis in adipose tissues.

"The PD microbiome has a diminished variety of bacterial taxonomic groups, especially the ones associated with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects and the increase of phyla, which has toxic effects. Predominantly, the reduction was observed in the Lachnospiraceae family, including Butyrivibrio, Pseudobutyrivibrio, Coprococcus, Blautia and SCFAs-producing Prevotellaceae. The increased amount of Enterobacteriaceae is linked to the severity of postural instability and walking difficulties. Moreover, the PD microbiome is characterised by increased Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium species and decreased amount of Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae. The overgrowth of Akkermansia spp. in PD patients may be strain-specific and can be related to immune-response alterations, decreased mucus thicknesses, and increased constipation. Faecalibacterium family is a crucial player producing SCFAs and anti-inflammatory metabolites, maintaining gut health. Faecalibacterium balance disturbances can lead to impaired gut-barrier function, increasing the risk of infection with enteric pathogens and boosting alpha-synuclein formation. Similarly, the Lachnospiraceae family can produce butyrate, important for the proper function of the gut epithelium. Decreased Lachnospiraceae quantity might aggravate gut inflammation, stimulate toxin production, and damage the integrity of the gut epithelial barrier. PD patients' intestinal microflora were characterised by a diminished abundance of Lachnospiraceae, which was positively correlated with PD progress, cognitive decline, and impaired motor functions. These microbiome's compositional changes correlate well with some metabolic switches. PD microbiota show reduced SCFAs production, decreased carbohydrate fermentation, and augmented proteolytic fermentation. Chen et al. demonstrated that the SCFA level was relevant to microbiota composition changes and the clinical severity of PD. The levels of SCFAs acetate, butyrate, and propionate in fecal samples of PD patients were significantly reduced, contrary to their elevated concentration in plasma. Rodent models of PD disease have shown a positive effect of SCFAs on behavior and PD symptoms. Butyrate, as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, exerts neuroprotective activity, reducing dopaminergic cell death, and motor impairment, and improving cognitive functions. Taken together, SCFAs play an important role in protection from PD disease and could be proposed as representative gut-oriented indicators for diversifying individuals with PD and placing disease progression.",16553034.0,980,997,Butyrate,2201.0,2209.0,Chemical,2318.0,2334.0,motor impairment,Disease,improve
"Insufficient dietary fiber intake is considered to be an important risk factor for diabetes. The decrease in the production of SCFAs counts for an important reason here. Modulation of dietary SCFAs is thought to reshape the gut microbiota in diabetes and ameliorate diabetes. SCFAs increase fatty acid oxidation and energy expenditure to decrease the risk of suffering from T2D. Of note, T2D patients have lower levels of butyrate-generating bacteria. Butyrate could promote the secretion of postprandial insulin; and the increase in fecal propionic acid was associated with an increase in T2D risk. In oral glucose tolerance test, a high butyrate-producing microbiota was associated with an improved insulin response (indicating improved beta-cell function), and butyrate concentration was directly related to postprandial insulin sensitivity. Besides, in signal transduction regulation, butyrate could also inhibit HDAC expression in juvenile diabetic rats to modulate the p38/ERK/MAPK signaling pathway, which ultimately prevents beta-cell apoptosis and improves glucose homeostasis.",18120409.0,29K5wsUCY9,oIvNXqjjSP,SCFAs,192.0,197.0,Chemical,224.0,238.0,gut microbiota,Species,affects
"The gut microbiota is critical to human health, such as digesting nutrients, forming the intestinal epithelial barrier, regulating immune function, producing vitamins and hormones, and producing metabolites to interact with the host.

In patients with CVDs and corresponding risk factors, the composition and ratio of gut microbiota have significant differences compared with their healthy counterparts. Therefore, gut microbiota dysbiosis, gut microbiota-generated metabolites, and the related signaling pathway may serve as explanations for some of the mechanisms about the occurrence and development of CVDs.

"Besides the propagation of an inflammatory state, microbial endotoxins are probably involved in AD's inflammatory amyloidosis. Metagenomics analysis showed that patients suffering from cognitive dysfunctions related to amyloidosis demonstrated elevated amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neurotoxic compounds.

"However host-microbiota interplay is not exclusively restricted to cell-cell interactions. Intestinal microbes are capable of producing a plethora of different types of compounds, i.e., small molecules (amino acids, neurotransmitters, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and other fatty acid derivatives, indoles, vitamins, and cofactors), polysaccharides, and proteins (i.e., bacteriocins), which have been reported as important factors in shaping the bacterial community and modulation of the immune system. It has been demonstrated that intestinal bacterial strains such as Escherichia coli or Lactobacillus spp. interact directly with the host's CNS (central nervous system), as they can release neurotransmitters such as dopamine, noradrenaline, histamine, acetylcholine, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), or serotonin. This metabolic status of the microbiome is also vulnerable to dysbiosis and compositional changes and often leads to metabolic disturbances. For example, dysbiosis can induce elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, intensifying oxidative stress and neuronal inflammatory processes.

"BAs, as by-products of cholesterol metabolism, are the main organic component of bile and are synthesized in hepatocytes. Cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) are primary BAs directly synthesized from cholesterol; secondary BAs include deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholic acid (LCA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and their glycine and taurine conjugated forms. BAs are excreted into the intestine to aid in the digestion and absorption of lipids and combine with farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and takeda-G-protein receptor 5 (TGR5) (Fig. 2). There is a strong biochemical relationship between BAs and gut microbiota. Some gut microbiota in healthy people can convert conjugated BAs into free BAs, and can transform BAs into secondary BAs with the help of bile salt hydrolase (BSH) and cholesterol 7-alpha hydroxy-lase (CYP7A1), so as to reduce blood cholesterol by affecting the enterohepatic circulation of BAs. Besides, the gut microbiota affects the metabolism of BAs by regulating the activity of BSH to reduce LDL cholesterol levels. BAs have bacteriostatic properties and an antimicrobial effect. BAs destroy the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane and thereby change the intestinal microecology. BAs also prevent bacteria from overgrowth and decrease inflammation. More importantly, BAs are also closely associated with CVDs. For example, BAs levels in the feces of patients with CVDs are different from those in healthy individuals.

"The origins of Parkinson's disease are the result of many factors such as increased age, polygenic factors (disease-segregating mutations in alpha-synuclein protein occurring in 15% of PD patients), toxins, and infectious agents. In 2006, Braak et al. assumed the gut-related origins of Parkinson's disease. One of the key pathological hallmarks of PD is Lewy bodies, being eosinophilic inclusion forms of misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates. Importantly, alpha-synuclein protein has a tendency to misfold and form aggregates. Its accumulation has been detected during bacterial and viral infections in the gut. Moreover, it can be recognized as a characteristic indicator of PD neural degeneration. This protein aggregate can boost the local immune response. Interestingly, alpha-synuclein deposition has been confirmed in the neurons of the intestinal submucosa, together with a possibility of the alpha-synuclein transport to the brain via the vagus nerve (translocation of prion-like proteins). Misfolded alpha-synuclein triggers neuronal dysfunction and progressive degeneration, thereby enabling disease progression.

Preclinical tests on genetically modified mice with PD demonstrated the correlation between Akkermansia muciniphila and Bilophila wadsworthia abundance and decreased the mice motor activity. Furthermore, Akkermansia muciniphila produces high amounts of pro-inflammatory hydrogen sulphide, correlated with PD pathology and being a neurotoxin affecting brain mitochondrial energy homeostasis through the inhibition of brain glutathione concentration.

"The PD microbiome has a diminished variety of bacterial taxonomic groups, especially the ones associated with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects and the increase of phyla, which has toxic effects. Predominantly, the reduction was observed in the Lachnospiraceae family, including Butyrivibrio, Pseudobutyrivibrio, Coprococcus, Blautia and SCFAs-producing Prevotellaceae. The increased amount of Enterobacteriaceae is linked to the severity of postural instability and walking difficulties. Moreover, the PD microbiome is characterised by increased Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium species and decreased amount of Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae. The overgrowth of Akkermansia spp. in PD patients may be strain-specific and can be related to immune-response alterations, decreased mucus thicknesses, and increased constipation. Faecalibacterium family is a crucial player producing SCFAs and anti-inflammatory metabolites, maintaining gut health. Faecalibacterium balance disturbances can lead to impaired gut-barrier function, increasing the risk of infection with enteric pathogens and boosting alpha-synuclein formation. Similarly, the Lachnospiraceae family can produce butyrate, important for the proper function of the gut epithelium. Decreased Lachnospiraceae quantity might aggravate gut inflammation, stimulate toxin production, and damage the integrity of the gut epithelial barrier. PD patients' intestinal microflora were characterised by a diminished abundance of Lachnospiraceae, which was positively correlated with PD progress, cognitive decline, and impaired motor functions. These microbiome's compositional changes correlate well with some metabolic switches. PD microbiota show reduced SCFAs production, decreased carbohydrate fermentation, and augmented proteolytic fermentation. Chen et al. demonstrated that the SCFA level was relevant to microbiota composition changes and the clinical severity of PD. The levels of SCFAs acetate, butyrate, and propionate in fecal samples of PD patients were significantly reduced, contrary to their elevated concentration in plasma. Rodent models of PD disease have shown a positive effect of SCFAs on behavior and PD symptoms. Butyrate, as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, exerts neuroprotective activity, reducing dopaminergic cell death, and motor impairment, and improving cognitive functions. Taken together, SCFAs play an important role in protection from PD disease and could be proposed as representative gut-oriented indicators for diversifying individuals with PD and placing disease progression.",16553034.0,1007,941Jb8AKzj,Faecalibacterium,842.0,858.0,Species,896.0,901.0,SCFAs,Chemical,None

However, the postprandial blood glucose level induced by different diets could also impact the composition of gut microbiota. SCFAs is the main metabolite in the glucose metabolism and a high-fiber plant-based diet was reported to increase SCFAs-producing microbiota.

"Particularly, SCFAs also have anti-inflammatory functions. It was reported that the butyrate and propionate can inhibit the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and NF-kappaB signaling pathways. These may be because that SCFAs can inhibit the activity of HDAC, inactivate the NF-kappaB pathway and decrease the expression of interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-6, and TNF-alpha, which further control inflammation. Meanwhile, butyrate increases the acetylation of H3 histone in the Forkhead box protein P3 (FOXP3) promoter by inhibiting HDAC4, thus promoting Treg differentiation, affecting G1-phase-specific cyclins, and further resulting in the markedly inhibited proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, thereby inhibiting myocardial fibrosis and improving heart function.",17066164.0,cN7zCMP9Dw,nLxybxAi7Q,Treg,539.0,543.0,Cellline,571.0,596.0,G1-phase-specific cyclins,Species,affects
"The mechanism by which BCAAs induce insulin resistance is still not fully understood. The rise of BCAA levels is found to regulate glycolipid metabolism, cause insulin resistance, and increase the risk of T2D. Other animal experiments have shown that elevated BCAAs are transferred to skeletal muscle, and are interfered with lipid metabolism, which causes the accumulation of lipid metabolites and ultimately leads to skeletal muscle insulin resistance. Additionally, BCAAs are the key regulatory factor of mTORC1. It activates mTORC1 and ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (S6K1) by inducing the phosphorylation of IRS1, blocking the insulin signaling pathway, and eventually causing insulin resistance. However, 2 other studies have shown that BCAAs may exert their functions without mTORC1. One study reported that the metabolites of BCAAs, 3-hydroxy isobutyrate, could cause insulin resistance by promoting skeletal muscle sprouting. Another study reported that a diet rich in BCAAs can cause overeating, obesity, and shortened lifespan, which was not related to the mTOR signaling pathway in the liver but is mainly due to hyperphagia.",18449544.0,aGzo9pwBo1,2358,BCAAs,469.0,474.0,Chemical,576.0,580.0,S6K1,Species,start
"The health of the gut microbiome can vary depending on various factors including diet (e.g., ingestion of saturated/unsaturated dietary fats, vitamins, minerals, dairy products, alcoholic beverages, polyphenols containing food such as cocoa-rich chocolate, tea, or coffee), dietary patterns, geographical area, and diet-related habits (sometimes varying between males and females) and sex (the influence of sex hormones). A positive correlation between polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (N-3 PUFA), and alpha-linolenic acid (aLNA) ingestion and protection against PD development in dose-response trends was demonstrated. American studies demonstrated that PUFA replacement with increased animal fat intake (Western Diet) significantly increased the risk of PD in males only. Excessive animal fat intake can promote dysbiosis and the production of harmful microbial metabolites, which can increase the prevalence of the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, sex differences are implicated in the mental health and prevalence of psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, and neurodegenerative disorders. It has been demonstrated that PD patients usually have altered microbiome compositions compared with controls. Similar to AD, many sex differences in PD are correlated with the protective nature of estrogens, as they are impacted by the gut-brain axis and protect against oxidative damage, thereby supporting dopaminergic function. It has been demonstrated that at age 45, the estimated overall lifetime risk for AD is about 20% for females and 10% for males, which is followed by a disruption in the patient's gut microbiota composition. In summary, it is worth underlining the correlation between the gut microbiome, immune system and brain, mental health, and behavior.",16221004.0,fc4-c6LGnu,1842,animal fat,823.0,833.0,Chemical,853.0,862.0,dysbiosis,Disease,increase

More importantly, studies indicated that some types of microbes could be regarded as biomarkers for metabolism-related CVDs. For example, it has been reported that Dorea formicigenerans, Dorea longicatena and Collinsella aerofaciens are associated with obesity, and Lachnospiraceae is associated with lipid cardiovascular risk factors. Besides, Anaeroplasma and Haemophilus are negatively associated with cholesterol and triglycerides and positively associated with HDL.

"Recent evidence has demonstrated the importance of the gut microbiota in the formation and development of the immune system. The gut microbiota has profound effects on the formation of lymphoid tissue and the development of the immune system. It stimulates the development of intestinal-associated lymphoid tissues, activates lymphocytes, and regulates the production of immunoglobulin A to defend against pathogens. The structural components of gut microbiota such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), flagella, and peptidoglycan, can interact with receptors on human cells to stimulate and guide the host immune response. For instance, LPS binds to Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, flagella binds to TLR5, and peptidoglycan binds to TLR2, triggering the expression of a large number of downstream inflammatory factors, thereby affecting the cardiovascular system. Specially, LPS can interact with different receptors to induce inflammation and immune responses to increase intestinal permeability and CVDs susceptibility (Fig. 1).",16622924.0,NCzfqD_Fu4,283,LPS,630.0,633.0,Chemical,643.0,669.0,Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4,Species,Interacts_with

These commensal microbes make up about 20% of the total gut microbiota. They are indispensable for maintaining the physiological function of adult tissues and organs by synthesizing a variety of vitamins, participating in food digestion, producing lactic acid, promoting intestinal peristalsis, inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microbiota, and activating the immune system. For example, one of the most important commensal microbes in the human gut is Bifidobacterium, a strictly anaerobic gram-positive bacterium, which assists the human body in the digestion and absorption of nutrients, resists the invasion of harmful bacteria, improves the immune function of the body, secretes molecules to regulate immune function, and participates in the metabolism of substances in the intestine. Besides, another common commensal microbe, A. muciniphila, a gram-positive bacterium, reduces insulin sensitivity and is inversely associated with the development of obesity and diabetes.

In mechanism, TMAO enhances platelet hyperreactivity by altering Ca2+ signaling and elicits a pro-thrombotic effect. Especially, TMAO seems to induce systemic inflammation that contributes to CAD progression. This is particularly relevant given that TMAO directly activates inflammatory pathways, and elicits perturbations in membrane dynamics in human aortic ECs and smooth muscle cells.

"Besides the propagation of an inflammatory state, microbial endotoxins are probably involved in AD's inflammatory amyloidosis. Metagenomics analysis showed that patients suffering from cognitive dysfunctions related to amyloidosis demonstrated elevated amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neurotoxic compounds.

"Experimental research confirms the hypothesis regarding SCFA reduction in autoimmune diseases (MS among others) and altered gut microbiota. A low level of SCFAs dysregulates Treg cell functions, leading to insufficient immune tolerance towards endogenous components and enteric microbiota. However, this process can be reversed by SCFAs supplementation (e.g., propionic acid). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing NFkappaB activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation and on microglial cells in vitro. TUDCA binds to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) expressed in microglial cells. This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS). Experimental results demonstrated that TUDCA acted as a double-edged sword, triggering microglia enhancement in anti-inflammatory and alternatively activated markers and on the other hand reducing the infiltration of macrophages and microglia with expressed pro-inflammatory markers. Interestingly, during neuroinflammation, microglial cells change their morphology, converting themselves into reactive macrophage-like forms. However, microglial cells are flexible, as they can sometimes polarize towards alternatively activated phenotypes, promoting CNS pathologies (proinflammatory or M1 microglia), or exert anti-inflammatory effects, boosting cell repair and remodeling. Bile acids were identified as nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor agonists, leading to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) depletion (in a mouse model) and neuroinflammatory process adjustment.

"Previous results have indicated that the metabolic regulation of BAs may be associated with T2D but the specific changes in BAs and the related mechanisms remain to be studied. It is also unclear how the different types of BAs change in patients with T2D. A study also suggested that patients with T2D had no change in plasma total BAs, but had an increase in DCA and a decrease in CDCA in plasma. Another study found that the plasma total BA concentration in patients with T2D was not significantly different from that of healthy people; however, the concentration of DCA in the plasma of patients with T2D was significantly higher than that of healthy controls. The mechanism may be that FXR and TGR5 are inhibited during insulin resistance, and the most effective natural ligands of the receptors, DCA and CA, are compensatorily increased. Besides, circulating BAs levels including DCA, TCA, TDCA, and glycodeoxycholic acid, are positively associated with the risk of T2D, while taurohyodeoxycholic acid is negatively associated with diabetes.

"Scientific evidence indicates that the metabolic status of microbiota exerts a more important role than the equilibrium between bacterial species. Microbial metabolites can act as positive modulators of the gut-brain-axis constituents, boosting the immune cells and exerting a positive/protective effect on neurodegenerative disease progression. On the other hand, disrupted equilibrium between microbial species often leads to specific switches in the microbial metabolome, which may be harmful and associated with neurodegenerative disease progression. For example, dysregulation of Gram-negative bacteria in the gastrointestinal area leads to the production of harmful metabolites (i.e., endo- and exotoxins, saccharides, and amyloids). Exotoxins, such as LPS, which have the ability to activate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, exert negative effects. LPS belongs to glycolipid molecules, mostly produced by Gram-negative bacterial strains. These molecules participate in the integrity maintenance of the bacterial outer-membrane permeability barrier, playing an important role in host-pathogen interplay. The overproduction of bacterial LPS can cause the activation of the macrophage-monocyte nod-like receptor P3 inflammasome, therefore stimulating the production of cytokines with pro-inflammatory activity, such as IL-18 or IL-1beta. LPS can be translocated and intensify neuroinflammatory diseases such as AD.

"The gut microbiome is crucially engaged in the regulation and maintenance of human health and homeostasis, i.e., proper intestine motion, fibre digestion, regulating the development of host immunity, and exerting a protective effect against pathogenic factors (such as Campylobacter jejuni, Helicobacter pylori, and Clostridium difficile). The Irish ELDERMET study (Elderly to benefit from Research Project) demonstrated the correlation between intestinal microbiota diversity and health outcomes such as overall health, frailty, and proper immune functions, underlying the gut microbiota composition as a possible indicator of healthy ageing. Multiple studies showed the interplay between the intestinal microbiota and modulation of central nervous system (CNS) functions and neurodegeneration processes, pointing to the microbiome-gut-brain axis as one of the factors modulating host homeostasis in health and disease. In the past decade, the alterations of the gut microbiota, which are called dysbiosis, have been connected with the pathophysiology of numerous common diseases such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, gastrointestinal diseases, and cardiovascular events. Dysbiosis state is also implicated in neurological and neurodegenerative disorders such as autism, and Alzheimer's (AD) or Parkinson's (PD) diseases.

It has been demonstrated that the alteration of the metabolites occurred, especially during disease progression. Experimental results indicate the correlation between PD and mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, the lower levels of BCAAs and aromatic amino acids have been observed in stool samples during this period in comparison with the healthy control group, indicating a dysbiosis state in the gut microbiota.

"Some of the studies performed show a connection between the pathological microbiota and Alzheimer's disease. Screening tests identified the connection between Escherichia and Shigella bacterial species and increased systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine-related processes, reported in patients with Alzheimer's. Increased inflammatory processes and oxidative stress conditions can trigger neurodegeneration observed in people with Alzheimer's disease. The previously mentioned species belong to Gram-negative bacteria, which are capable of producing huge amounts of pro-inflammatory lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), thereby causing intestinal inflammation and gut barrier disruption. Increased gut permeability permits the transport and the systemic and brain accumulation of LPS or other bacterial toxins and the propagation of an inflammatory state.

"In summary, the gut microbiota generates a series of bioactive metabolites to interact with host metabolism. These metabolites mainly include SCFAs, primary and secondary BAs, TMAO, and so on. Among these metabolites, some exert synergistic effects to promote host health by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system to control glucose metabolism. For example, SCFAs interact with human hormones such as GLP-1 and PYY to effect energy uptake and the development of obesity. SCFAs are beneficial for regulating appetite and energy intake, and preventing the formation of atherosclerosis. Other metabolites, such as TMAO and phenylacetylglutamine (PAGln), may be toxic. For example, TMAO may be proatherogenic to promote the process of thrombosis and atherosclerosis, thereby increasing the risk of cardiovascular events. Patients with CVDs had lower levels of SCFA generation and higher levels of TMAO production due to the change in gut microbiota. Furthermore, TMAO causes vascular endothelial damage and promotes the production of atherosclerotic plaques. TMAO can also increase the release of intracellular calcium ions, enhance the reactivity of platelets, and increase the risk of thrombosis to increase CVDs susceptibility. Besides, PAGln enhances platelet reactivity and thrombosis, leading to CVDs. Taken together, mounting evidence suggests that changes in gut microbiota metabolites are part of the crucial mechanisms by which the gut microbiota regulates the occurrence and development of CVDs.",18055127.0,veEOLi8JSF,1171,gut microbiota metabolites,1371.0,1397.0,Chemical,1505.0,1509.0,CVDs,Disease,Marker/Mechanism

"The PD microbiome has a diminished variety of bacterial taxonomic groups, especially the ones associated with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects and the increase of phyla, which has toxic effects. Predominantly, the reduction was observed in the Lachnospiraceae family, including Butyrivibrio, Pseudobutyrivibrio, Coprococcus, Blautia and SCFAs-producing Prevotellaceae. The increased amount of Enterobacteriaceae is linked to the severity of postural instability and walking difficulties. Moreover, the PD microbiome is characterised by increased Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium species and decreased amount of Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae. The overgrowth of Akkermansia spp. in PD patients may be strain-specific and can be related to immune-response alterations, decreased mucus thicknesses, and increased constipation. Faecalibacterium family is a crucial player producing SCFAs and anti-inflammatory metabolites, maintaining gut health. Faecalibacterium balance disturbances can lead to impaired gut-barrier function, increasing the risk of infection with enteric pathogens and boosting alpha-synuclein formation. Similarly, the Lachnospiraceae family can produce butyrate, important for the proper function of the gut epithelium. Decreased Lachnospiraceae quantity might aggravate gut inflammation, stimulate toxin production, and damage the integrity of the gut epithelial barrier. PD patients' intestinal microflora were characterised by a diminished abundance of Lachnospiraceae, which was positively correlated with PD progress, cognitive decline, and impaired motor functions. These microbiome's compositional changes correlate well with some metabolic switches. PD microbiota show reduced SCFAs production, decreased carbohydrate fermentation, and augmented proteolytic fermentation. Chen et al. demonstrated that the SCFA level was relevant to microbiota composition changes and the clinical severity of PD. The levels of SCFAs acetate, butyrate, and propionate in fecal samples of PD patients were significantly reduced, contrary to their elevated concentration in plasma. Rodent models of PD disease have shown a positive effect of SCFAs on behavior and PD symptoms. Butyrate, as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, exerts neuroprotective activity, reducing dopaminergic cell death, and motor impairment, and improving cognitive functions. Taken together, SCFAs play an important role in protection from PD disease and could be proposed as representative gut-oriented indicators for diversifying individuals with PD and placing disease progression.",16553034.0,991,3ycBziSW2J,PD,1693.0,1695.0,Disease,1789.0,1813.0,proteolytic fermentation,Chemical,increase
"The gut microbiota is critical to human health, such as digesting nutrients, forming the intestinal epithelial barrier, regulating immune function, producing vitamins and hormones, and producing metabolites to interact with the host. Meanwhile, increasing evidence indicates that the gut microbiota has a strong correlation with the occurrence, progression and treatment of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). In patients with CVDs and corresponding risk factors, the composition and ratio of gut microbiota have significant differences compared with their healthy counterparts. Therefore, gut microbiota dysbiosis, gut microbiota-generated metabolites, and the related signaling pathway may serve as explanations for some of the mechanisms about the occurrence and development of CVDs. Several studies have also demonstrated that many traditional and latest therapeutic treatments of CVDs are associated with the gut microbiota and its generated metabolites and related signaling pathways. Given that information, we summarized the latest advances in the current research regarding the effect of gut microbiota on health, the main cardiovascular risk factors, and CVDs, highlighted the roles and mechanisms of several metabolites, and introduced corresponding promising treatments for CVDs regarding the gut microbiota.

Moreover, experiments performed in mice models revealed that the altered microbiota observed in the HD-suffering individuals at the pre-motor symptomatic stage highly influence health status. HD microbiota composition indicated dysbiosis, disturbances in cytokine levels, and an increase in sulphur metabolism characterized by hydrogen sulphide overproduction and negatively influencing gut health. Ultimately, the gut dysbiosis state was also described in a transgenic mice model representing Huntington's disease. Kong et al. found increased Bacteroidetes and decreased Firmicutes levels in a R6/1 transgenic mice model. In this study, dysbiosis was followed by body weight deterioration, gastrointestinal motility problems, and the loss of motor ability. Subsequent studies performed by the same group revealed the negative correlation between Blautia producta and butyrate production.

"Recently, bacterial strains producing SCFAs have gained extreme popularity. SCFAs are small organic monocarboxylic acids, released after the fermentation of indigestible alimentary fiber (mainly galacto- or fructooligosaccharides), plant-derived polysaccharides, or the metabolism of amino acids, and are considered a key gut-derived metabolites with beneficial health effects and as essential in gut-brain crosstalk. The type of formed SCFAs is correlated with the kind of fiber ingested and the overall gut microbiota population. For example, microbes belonging to Firmicutes phyla (e.g., Lachnospiraceae, Eubacterium, or Roseburia belonging to the Clostridia class) are responsible for the main production of butyrate, whereas Bifidobacteria spp. produce lactate and acetate. SCFAs are significantly reduced during dysbiosis, where disrupted gut epithelial integrity, inflammation, and altered microbiome metabolic processes occur. In a healthy colon, levels of SCFAs can vary depending on a diet; however, in multiple diseases, these levels are altered.

"At the end of this chapter, it is worth mentioning the fact that the interaction between the microbiome and the host is bidirectional, and some metabolic changes, which could be a pathological result of disease progression, also influence microbiome metabolism. A good example is a disturbance in cholesterol homeostasis, which correlates with an augmented probability of Alzheimer's disease occurrence. In addition, alteration of the intestinal microbiota composition with the subsequent fluctuations in the serum and brain levels of bile acids (BAs) is involved in the development of AD. BAs can act as detergents, affecting BBB permeability, and incrementing brain influx of peripheral cholesterol and BAs. Therefore, proper cholesterol elimination pathways play a crucial role in AD prevention and treatment. The gut microbiome is a main ""organ"" metabolizing secondary bile acids. Peripheral cholesterol is eliminated mainly through its liver conversion to BAs. The gut microbiota performs BA transformation via deconjugation and dehydroxylation, leading to secondary BA formation. Nho et al. investigated the correlation between neurodegeneration and BAs, B-amyloid, and tau protein concentration. The application of targeted metabolomics enabled the determination of the association between intestinal microbiota-derived secondary bile acids and sera BAs. Interestingly, the analysis indicated an imbalanced BA ratio, underlying an increased amount of secondary BAs over primary ones. Another clinical study confirmed the correlation between bile acid metabolic profile and the prevalence of AD and mild cognitive impairment, showing similar BA ratio disruptions. Decreased cognitive functions were positively associated with increased concentrations of secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid, and glycolithocholic acid.

"SCFAs may prevent obesity by regulating the homeostasis of glucose and lipid metabolism. For instance, acetate decreases appetite and nutrient intake.

Butyrate provides energy for colon cells, maintains the integrity of intestinal walls, and improves the insulin response, which activates gluconeogenesis to maintain the balance of glucose and energy through the cAMP pathway. And one study indicated that oral butyrate intake prevents obesity and insulin resistance. Furthermore, the role of SCFAs in metabolic hemostasis is related to other factors. Adenosine monophosphate activating protein (AMPK) is a heterotrimeric enzyme that stimulates liver and muscle fatty acid oxidation pathways. SCFAs promote the activity of AMPK and improve its ability to oxidize fatty acids. Last, SCFAs can affect the development of dyslipidemia. SCFAs increase the expression of fasting-induced adipose factor (FIAF), a circulating lipoprotein lipase inhibitor, by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-gamma), thereby decreasing the activity of lipoproteinases and inhibiting lipolysis in adipose tissues.

These multi-species ecological arrangements mostly comprise anaerobic bacteria, with at least 500-1000 different species and more than 7000 strains, mainly from the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes families (accounting for approx. 90% of bacterial species). In addition, the gut microbiome is co-inhabited by bacteria belonging to Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia phyla, as well as archaea, viruses, fungi, bacteriophages, and protozoa (especially during pathologic conditions), which reside in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, maintaining symbiosis with the host.",16114793.0,41,DG7rnA8m29,human,220.0,225.0,Species,810.0,831.0,Verrucomicrobia phyla,Species,None
"In addition, phosphatidylcholine can be hydrolyzed into choline in the intestine in vivo, and the gut microbiota can convert choline into trimethylamine (TMA). After being absorbed by the intestinal tract, TMA is further transported to the liver and oxidized into TMAO by liver flavin monooxygenase 3 (FMO3), which plays an important role in human health and CVDs. TMAO also reduces reverse cholesterol transportation, and changes BAs composition. Some studies genetically manipulated hepatic FMO3 to modulate lipid homeostasis, suggesting a major role of gut microbiota in lipid metabolism. Furthermore, changes in TMAO levels have been found in metabolic diseases such as fatty liver and hyperlipidemia, suggesting that lipid metabolism mediated by gut microbiota plays an important role in the occurrence and development of diseases.",17118299.0,921,920,fatty liver and hyperlipidemia,674.0,704.0,Disease,647.0,665.0,metabolic diseases,Disease,part_of

"Contrarily, as a positive example, balanced diets (i.e., Mediterranean diet and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) can be mentioned. Diets abundant in natural compounds with anti-inflammatory activity, antioxidants, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and plant-origin nutrients (proteins, polyphenols, vitamins, and fibers), together with reduced caloric intake, such as the Mediterranean diet, are correlated with a lower risk of dementia, decrease age-related cognitive deterioration, and the risk of neurodegeneration occurrence. Moreover, the Mediterranean diet increases the amount of gut Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus and reduces malignant bacteria belonging to Clostridium and Bacteroides, thereby improving memory and cognitive processes in healthy females after menopause and disorder patients. Additionally, following such a diet significantly reduces amyloid aggregation and therefore the frequency of amyloid-related diseases in the aging population.

"Several studies have suggested that different BAs profiles are closely related to obesity. It was reported that 12-hydroxylated (12-OH) BAs such as CA and DCA increase obesity susceptibility, while non-12-OH BAs such as CDCA, UDCA and LCA reduce obesity susceptibility. Mice with higher levels of non-12-OH BAs gained weight slowly and had less metabolic disturbance, while the rapidly gaining weight mice had significantly lower levels of non-12-OH BAs such as UDCA. UDCA intake significantly reduced weight gain and metabolic disturbances induced by high-fat diet. Another study also provided evidence that a high-fat diet caused obesity by increasing the levels of 12-OH BAs. In a rat model, high-fat diet caused increases in the total BAs, DCA and taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA) in plasma and liver tissues, and increases in DCA in intestinal tissues and feces.

Metagenomics analysis showed that patients suffering from cognitive dysfunctions related to amyloidosis demonstrated elevated amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neurotoxic compounds. In these patients, increased inflammation was probably related to Eubacterium deficiency, and an overabundance of gram-negative Escherichia and Shigella species, which are known amyloid producers. They manufacture ""curli"" amyloid fibers, accumulated extracellularly through an elaborated system. Further studies revealed that the overproduction of Abeta plaques is correlated with excessive growth of Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycobacterium and Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus spp..

"In the past decade, single dietary factors which can positively manipulate the gut microbiota-brain axis through microbiome modulation have gained significant attention. One of these factors is probiotic bacteria and/or prebiotics. Probiotics are defined as microbial organisms with a beneficial role in the host's health and homeostasis, which help to preserve digestive, metabolic, immune, and neuroendocrine functions. Naturally probiotic bacteria can be found in fermented food. Experimental results revealed that the administration of probiotics alone or in combination with prebiotics (fructooligosaccharides or galactooligosaccharides) improved the gastrointestinal barrier, which is the first line of ""defence"" from harmful factors occurring in food, and the microbiome. Probiotics and prebiotics are well-documented ""problem-solution"" for gastrointestinal diseases. Moreover, probiotics can reduce CNS inflammatory processes and activation of microglia, demonstrating promising potential for use in neurodegenerative diseases as ingestible ""psychobiotics"". Many studies indicate that the ingestion of probiotics can serve as a microbiological strategy against neurodegenerative diseases such as AD; however, the exact mechanism is under investigation. Experiments performed on mice underline the hypothesis that mechanisms related to neuroprotective effects of Bifidobacterium breve administration may be connected with neuroinflammation and cognition pathways, probably through the production of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) neurotransmitter and the regulation of the gut microbial composition. Clinical results of a randomized double-blind controlled trial revealed that 3-month exposure to Lactobacillus spp. And a Bifidobacterium bifidum ""cocktail"" enhanced cognitive functions and memory, as examined in a mini-mental state test. It was demonstrated that Bifidobacterium breve exerts positive and unique activity in AD patients, improving cognitive functions and reducing neuroinflammation.

"The main end product of bacterial fermentation, and therefore the most predominant, is the SCFA propionic acid (PA), which positively influences CNS regeneration processes such as remyelination (due to the former increase of the amount of intestinal T regulatory cells and protecting against the white matter and axonal loss). Hoyles et al. demonstrated the contribution of propionate to the BBB integrity and the modulation of gut-brain axis. BBB homeostasis and integrity are necessary for proper CNS development and function. Recently, a positive correlation between microbial-induced BBB dysfunction (barrier integrity disturbances followed by leakage) and disorders such as AD has been established. Another member of the SCFAs family, which has a documented influence on homeostasis and AD progression, is butyrate, an important driver of metabolic processes with the ability to influence intestinal macrophages, increasing immunomodulation and decreasing the histone deacetylase inhibition-mediated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Butyrate, as an SCFA, influences the immune response crossing the BBB and drives the maturation and metabolism of microglia cells. It regulates the secretion of gut hormones, such as glucagon-like peptide-1, which can improve hippocampus neuroplasticity. Additionally, in vitro tests conducted by Ho et al. revealed that bacterial SCFAs, such as valeric and butyric acid, exhibited a strong inhibitory effect on amyloid-beta aggregation, which can be absorbed in the intestines and have a negative influence on disease progression.",16144118.0,445,446,BBB dysfunction,588.0,603.0,Disease,679.0,681.0,AD,Disease,Associated_with
"At the end of this chapter, it is worth mentioning the fact that the interaction between the microbiome and the host is bidirectional, and some metabolic changes, which could be a pathological result of disease progression, also influence microbiome metabolism. A good example is a disturbance in cholesterol homeostasis, which correlates with an augmented probability of Alzheimer's disease occurrence. In addition, alteration of the intestinal microbiota composition with the subsequent fluctuations in the serum and brain levels of bile acids (BAs) is involved in the development of AD. BAs can act as detergents, affecting BBB permeability, and incrementing brain influx of peripheral cholesterol and BAs. Therefore, proper cholesterol elimination pathways play a crucial role in AD prevention and treatment. The gut microbiome is a main ""organ"" metabolizing secondary bile acids. Peripheral cholesterol is eliminated mainly through its liver conversion to BAs. The gut microbiota performs BA transformation via deconjugation and dehydroxylation, leading to secondary BA formation. Nho et al. investigated the correlation between neurodegeneration and BAs, B-amyloid, and tau protein concentration. The application of targeted metabolomics enabled the determination of the association between intestinal microbiota-derived secondary bile acids and sera BAs. Interestingly, the analysis indicated an imbalanced BA ratio, underlying an increased amount of secondary BAs over primary ones. Another clinical study confirmed the correlation between bile acid metabolic profile and the prevalence of AD and mild cognitive impairment, showing similar BA ratio disruptions. Decreased cognitive functions were positively associated with increased concentrations of secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid, and glycolithocholic acid.

"The health of the gut microbiome can vary depending on various factors including diet (e.g., ingestion of saturated/unsaturated dietary fats, vitamins, minerals, dairy products, alcoholic beverages, polyphenols containing food such as cocoa-rich chocolate, tea, or coffee), dietary patterns, geographical area, and diet-related habits (sometimes varying between males and females) and sex (the influence of sex hormones). A positive correlation between polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (N-3 PUFA), and alpha-linolenic acid (aLNA) ingestion and protection against PD development in dose-response trends was demonstrated. American studies demonstrated that PUFA replacement with increased animal fat intake (Western Diet) significantly increased the risk of PD in males only. Excessive animal fat intake can promote dysbiosis and the production of harmful microbial metabolites, which can increase the prevalence of the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, sex differences are implicated in the mental health and prevalence of psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, and neurodegenerative disorders. It has been demonstrated that PD patients usually have altered microbiome compositions compared with controls. Similar to AD, many sex differences in PD are correlated with the protective nature of estrogens, as they are impacted by the gut-brain axis and protect against oxidative damage, thereby supporting dopaminergic function. It has been demonstrated that at age 45, the estimated overall lifetime risk for AD is about 20% for females and 10% for males, which is followed by a disruption in the patient's gut microbiota composition.

"The mechanism by which BCAAs induce insulin resistance is still not fully understood. The rise of BCAA levels is found to regulate glycolipid metabolism, cause insulin resistance, and increase the risk of T2D.

"Aromatic amino acids including tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine are metabolized into indole and phenols by certain intestinal anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, and Peptostreptococcus. Tryptophan is decomposed into indole, indoleacetic acid, indole-3-lactic acid, 3-methylindole (skatole) and other indole compounds under the action of tryptophanase. Tryptophanase is the key enzyme that generates indole. The activity of the enzyme is easily induced by the substrate tryptophan, so when the amount of tryptophan changes in the colonic environment, the content of indole will fluctuate greatly. Of note, the metabolic products of aromatic amino acids generated by gut microbiota have a great impact on the pathology of cardiometabolic diseases. For example, indole propionic acid is associated with insulin sensitivity and appears to reduce the risk of diabetes. Moreover, the gut microbiota metabolizes dietary tryptophan to indoxyl, which further generates indoxyl sulfate through sulfonation. Excessive accumulation of indoxyl sulfate causes cardiomyocyte damage and increases thrombus formation.

"Experimental research confirms the hypothesis regarding SCFA reduction in autoimmune diseases (MS among others) and altered gut microbiota. A low level of SCFAs dysregulates Treg cell functions, leading to insufficient immune tolerance towards endogenous components and enteric microbiota. However, this process can be reversed by SCFAs supplementation (e.g., propionic acid). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing NFkappaB activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation and on microglial cells in vitro. TUDCA binds to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) expressed in microglial cells. This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS). Experimental results demonstrated that TUDCA acted as a double-edged sword, triggering microglia enhancement in anti-inflammatory and alternatively activated markers and on the other hand reducing the infiltration of macrophages and microglia with expressed pro-inflammatory markers. Interestingly, during neuroinflammation, microglial cells change their morphology, converting themselves into reactive macrophage-like forms. However, microglial cells are flexible, as they can sometimes polarize towards alternatively activated phenotypes, promoting CNS pathologies (proinflammatory or M1 microglia), or exert anti-inflammatory effects, boosting cell repair and remodeling. Bile acids were identified as nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor agonists, leading to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) depletion (in a mouse model) and neuroinflammatory process adjustment. The administration of the complex probiotic positively influenced the intestinal flora balance in patients diagnosed with MS. The probiotic prevented the onset of dysbiosis, significantly increasing the amount of Methanobrevibacter and Akkermansia, Prevotella, and Sutterella in MS patients, influencing gene expression and the production of beneficial bacterial metabolites.",16224291.0,MGmwre--Uk,1298,microglial cells,1114.0,1130.0,Cellline,1012.0,1050.0,G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1,Species,Location_of

"It is currently controversial whether supplementation with BCAAs would increase circulating BCAAs, thereby increasing the risk of diabetes. And reducing BCAAs intake promotes fat mass loss and insulin sensitivity in mice with obesity. A high BCAAs diet causes excessive feeding, mainly due to excessive appetite. Adding threonine to balance the composition of amino acids in the diet can inhibit food intake. Nevertheless, some studies have found that supplementary BCAAs, such as isoleucine and leucine, can improve insulin resistance and reduce weight to lower the risk of obesity and diabetes. The inconsistency may be due to the individual state of energy excess or energy deficiency. In terms of an excessive energy state, such as in patients with obesity or diabetes who have an impaired ability to degrade BCAAs, BCAAs and related metabolites accumulate in circulation to reduce insulin sensitivity and cause insulin resistance. In most elderly people with inadequate energy or athletes who maintain good fitness habits, BCAAs can improve the form of metabolism. In these people, BCAAs decomposition metabolism is increased by regulatory factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha coactivator (PGC-1alpha) and PPARalpha, so that BCAAs levels are maintained in a steady state, which ultimately promotes glucose intake and insulin sensitivity. This was supported by the study of Newgard, who pointed out that dietary intake of BCAAs might interact with a high-fat diet to induce abnormal metabolic phenotypes such as insulin resistance. Mice fed BCAAs alone did not develop insulin resistance. However, when mice were fed a high-fat diet supplemented with BCAAs, they developed insulin resistance. This study suggested that BCAAs only lead to insulin resistance in the presence of excess energy intake. Therefore, more studies are needed to explore the supplementation with BCAAs and insulin resistance as well as the development of cardiovascular risk factors.",19341206.0,2472,2473,mice,216.0,220.0,Species,739.0,747.0,patients,Species,None
"Previous results have indicated that the metabolic regulation of BAs may be associated with T2D but the specific changes in BAs and the related mechanisms remain to be studied. It is also unclear how the different types of BAs change in patients with T2D. A study also suggested that patients with T2D had no change in plasma total BAs, but had an increase in DCA and a decrease in CDCA in plasma. Another study found that the plasma total BA concentration in patients with T2D was not significantly different from that of healthy people; however, the concentration of DCA in the plasma of patients with T2D was significantly higher than that of healthy controls. The mechanism may be that FXR and TGR5 are inhibited during insulin resistance, and the most effective natural ligands of the receptors, DCA and CA, are compensatorily increased. Besides, circulating BAs levels including DCA, TCA, TDCA, and glycodeoxycholic acid, are positively associated with the risk of T2D, while taurohyodeoxycholic acid is negatively associated with diabetes. This may be due to the fact that hydrophobic BAs isoforms (such as DCA) have been shown to be involved in inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress with glucose dysregulation, and hydrophilic BAs isoforms (such as tauroursodeoxycholic acid) have been shown to prevent inflammation and enhance insulin sensitivity.",18340523.0,2040,fNM1AQyJOj,patients,284.0,292.0,Species,298.0,301.0,T2D,Disease,experiences

In mechanism, TMAO enhances platelet hyperreactivity by altering Ca2+ signaling and elicits a pro-thrombotic effect. Especially, TMAO seems to induce systemic inflammation that contributes to CAD progression.

"Insufficient dietary fiber intake is considered to be an important risk factor for diabetes. The decrease in the production of SCFAs counts for an important reason here. Modulation of dietary SCFAs is thought to reshape the gut microbiota in diabetes and ameliorate diabetes. SCFAs increase fatty acid oxidation and energy expenditure to decrease the risk of suffering from T2D. Of note, T2D patients have lower levels of butyrate-generating bacteria. Butyrate could promote the secretion of postprandial insulin; and the increase in fecal propionic acid was associated with an increase in T2D risk. In oral glucose tolerance test, a high butyrate-producing microbiota was associated with an improved insulin response (indicating improved beta-cell function), and butyrate concentration was directly related to postprandial insulin sensitivity.

"BAs, as by-products of cholesterol metabolism, are the main organic component of bile and are synthesized in hepatocytes. Cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) are primary BAs directly synthesized from cholesterol; secondary BAs include deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholic acid (LCA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and their glycine and taurine conjugated forms. BAs are excreted into the intestine to aid in the digestion and absorption of lipids and combine with farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and takeda-G-protein receptor 5 (TGR5) (Fig. 2). There is a strong biochemical relationship between BAs and gut microbiota. Some gut microbiota in healthy people can convert conjugated BAs into free BAs, and can transform BAs into secondary BAs with the help of bile salt hydrolase (BSH) and cholesterol 7-alpha hydroxy-lase (CYP7A1), so as to reduce blood cholesterol by affecting the enterohepatic circulation of BAs. Besides, the gut microbiota affects the metabolism of BAs by regulating the activity of BSH to reduce LDL cholesterol levels. BAs have bacteriostatic properties and an antimicrobial effect. BAs destroy the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane and thereby change the intestinal microecology. BAs also prevent bacteria from overgrowth and decrease inflammation. More importantly, BAs are also closely associated with CVDs. For example, BAs levels in the feces of patients with CVDs are different from those in healthy individuals.

"In the past decade, single dietary factors which can positively manipulate the gut microbiota-brain axis through microbiome modulation have gained significant attention. One of these factors is probiotic bacteria and/or prebiotics. Probiotics are defined as microbial organisms with a beneficial role in the host's health and homeostasis, which help to preserve digestive, metabolic, immune, and neuroendocrine functions. Naturally probiotic bacteria can be found in fermented food. Experimental results revealed that the administration of probiotics alone or in combination with prebiotics (fructooligosaccharides or galactooligosaccharides) improved the gastrointestinal barrier, which is the first line of ""defence"" from harmful factors occurring in food, and the microbiome. Probiotics and prebiotics are well-documented ""problem-solution"" for gastrointestinal diseases. Moreover, probiotics can reduce CNS inflammatory processes and activation of microglia, demonstrating promising potential for use in neurodegenerative diseases as ingestible ""psychobiotics"". Many studies indicate that the ingestion of probiotics can serve as a microbiological strategy against neurodegenerative diseases such as AD; however, the exact mechanism is under investigation. Experiments performed on mice underline the hypothesis that mechanisms related to neuroprotective effects of Bifidobacterium breve administration may be connected with neuroinflammation and cognition pathways, probably through the production of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) neurotransmitter and the regulation of the gut microbial composition. Clinical results of a randomized double-blind controlled trial revealed that 3-month exposure to Lactobacillus spp. And a Bifidobacterium bifidum ""cocktail"" enhanced cognitive functions and memory, as examined in a mini-mental state test.

"Scientific evidence indicates that the metabolic status of microbiota exerts a more important role than the equilibrium between bacterial species. Microbial metabolites can act as positive modulators of the gut-brain-axis constituents, boosting the immune cells and exerting a positive/protective effect on neurodegenerative disease progression. On the other hand, disrupted equilibrium between microbial species often leads to specific switches in the microbial metabolome, which may be harmful and associated with neurodegenerative disease progression. For example, dysregulation of Gram-negative bacteria in the gastrointestinal area leads to the production of harmful metabolites (i.e., endo- and exotoxins, saccharides, and amyloids). Exotoxins, such as LPS, which have the ability to activate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, exert negative effects. LPS belongs to glycolipid molecules, mostly produced by Gram-negative bacterial strains. These molecules participate in the integrity maintenance of the bacterial outer-membrane permeability barrier, playing an important role in host-pathogen interplay. The overproduction of bacterial LPS can cause the activation of the macrophage-monocyte nod-like receptor P3 inflammasome, therefore stimulating the production of cytokines with pro-inflammatory activity, such as IL-18 or IL-1beta. LPS can be translocated and intensify neuroinflammatory diseases such as AD.

"The origins of Parkinson's disease are the result of many factors such as increased age, polygenic factors (disease-segregating mutations in alpha-synuclein protein occurring in 15% of PD patients), toxins, and infectious agents. In 2006, Braak et al. assumed the gut-related origins of Parkinson's disease. One of the key pathological hallmarks of PD is Lewy bodies, being eosinophilic inclusion forms of misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates. Importantly, alpha-synuclein protein has a tendency to misfold and form aggregates. Its accumulation has been detected during bacterial and viral infections in the gut. Moreover, it can be recognized as a characteristic indicator of PD neural degeneration. This protein aggregate can boost the local immune response. Interestingly, alpha-synuclein deposition has been confirmed in the neurons of the intestinal submucosa, together with a possibility of the alpha-synuclein transport to the brain via the vagus nerve (translocation of prion-like proteins). Misfolded alpha-synuclein triggers neuronal dysfunction and progressive degeneration, thereby enabling disease progression. Additionally, alpha-synuclein deposition in CNS is associated with intestinal hyperpermeability, TLRs, and pro-inflammatory cytokine overexpression.

"Additionally, it has been reported that the intestinal microbiota plays a very crucial role in the neuroendocrine system, which is correlated to the gut-brain axis. As the major neuroendocrine system, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulates various pathophysiological processes in response to inside and outside stressors. It is increasingly recognized that the establishment of intestinal microbiota in early life can impact the development as well as the function of nervous system, especially regulating neuroendocrine function. In neonatal germ-free mice, colonization with B. infantis, and Bifidobacterium could attenuate the high sensitivity of the HPA axis and establish functional neural circuits. The imbalanced microbiota may fail to execute metabolic functions, brain function and neuromodulators. The regulation of neurohumoral-immune not only promotes the development of neurological diseases, but also promotes the occurrence and development of CVDs via the HPA axis and renin-angiotensin system (RAS). For example, dysregulation of the gut-brain axis was associated with hypertension. Interestingly, the gut microbiota can be called ""an endocrine organ"" that biologically regulates host metabolism, for affecting the host's endocrine system by altering the functional metabolism of important hormones such as leptin, ghrelin and cortisol.

"However host-microbiota interplay is not exclusively restricted to cell-cell interactions. Intestinal microbes are capable of producing a plethora of different types of compounds, i.e., small molecules (amino acids, neurotransmitters, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and other fatty acid derivatives, indoles, vitamins, and cofactors), polysaccharides, and proteins (i.e., bacteriocins), which have been reported as important factors in shaping the bacterial community and modulation of the immune system. It has been demonstrated that intestinal bacterial strains such as Escherichia coli or Lactobacillus spp. interact directly with the host's CNS (central nervous system), as they can release neurotransmitters such as dopamine, noradrenaline, histamine, acetylcholine, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), or serotonin. This metabolic status of the microbiome is also vulnerable to dysbiosis and compositional changes and often leads to metabolic disturbances. For example, dysbiosis can induce elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, intensifying oxidative stress and neuronal inflammatory processes.

"Given that the gut microbiota is essential in human health, changes in the composition and function of the gut microbiota may result in the development of diseases. Due to the influence of host genes, diet, antibiotic use, lifestyle, drugs as well as other factors, the composition and diversity of gut microbiota gradually change with interindividual variation. For example, a high-fat diet leads to an increase in the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. When the composition and proportion of gut microbiota change, inflammation and metabolic abnormalities can be induced, which contribute to the development of different diseases.

"SCFAs may prevent obesity by regulating the homeostasis of glucose and lipid metabolism. For instance, acetate decreases appetite and nutrient intake. Propionate activates intestinal gluconeogenesis by a gut-brain neural circuit to promote energy balance.

"In summary, the gut microbiota generates a series of bioactive metabolites to interact with host metabolism. These metabolites mainly include SCFAs, primary and secondary BAs, TMAO, and so on. Among these metabolites, some exert synergistic effects to promote host health by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system to control glucose metabolism. For example, SCFAs interact with human hormones such as GLP-1 and PYY to effect energy uptake and the development of obesity. SCFAs are beneficial for regulating appetite and energy intake, and preventing the formation of atherosclerosis. Other metabolites, such as TMAO and phenylacetylglutamine (PAGln), may be toxic. For example, TMAO may be proatherogenic to promote the process of thrombosis and atherosclerosis, thereby increasing the risk of cardiovascular events. Patients with CVDs had lower levels of SCFA generation and higher levels of TMAO production due to the change in gut microbiota. Furthermore, TMAO causes vascular endothelial damage and promotes the production of atherosclerotic plaques. TMAO can also increase the release of intracellular calcium ions, enhance the reactivity of platelets, and increase the risk of thrombosis to increase CVDs susceptibility. Besides, PAGln enhances platelet reactivity and thrombosis, leading to CVDs. Taken together, mounting evidence suggests that changes in gut microbiota metabolites are part of the crucial mechanisms by which the gut microbiota regulates the occurrence and development of CVDs.",18055127.0,x6kPS5prmv,1161,SCFAs,479.0,484.0,Chemical,575.0,590.0,atherosclerosis,Disease,prevents
"Changes in the composition of gut microbiota increase the risk of obesity, including increasing inflammation, insulin resistance, adiposity deposition, and the capability of harvesting energy from food. Obesity is associated with the changes in serum metabolites, mainly including metabolites of SCFAs, BCAAs, and BAs.",18095665.0,xPMFuKZKjA,1437,gut microbiota,30.0,44.0,Species,110.0,117.0,insulin,Species,worsen
"The gut microbiota in healthy people can influence intestinal epithelial cells to prevent the destruction of intestinal mucosa. It was found that butyrate derived from gut microbiota can regulate the repair of intestinal mucus barrier by activating the macrophage/wingless and int-1 (Wnt)/extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) signaling pathways which effectively separating the body from intestinal pathogens. Other researchers further found that Bifidobacterium brevis could reduce dextran sodium sulfate-induced apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells and reduce intestinal inflammation, which indicated that gut microbiota could protect intestinal mucosa by reducing apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells. Oral administration of commensal bacteria such as Bifidobacterium could also improve the function of intestinal barrier and inhibit the growth of pathobionts.",16620290.0,i_YM32MLmC,MnObcizCbD,butyrate,146.0,154.0,Chemical,284.0,287.0,Wnt,Species,start

"In addition, the abundance of gut microbiota is associated with salt sensitivity in hypertension. It was reported that moderate high salt stimulation reduced the survival of Lactobacillus in the intestine and increased TH17 cells, which could lead to an increase in blood pressure. Besides, gut microbiota has been found to promote angiotensin II-induced hypertension by supporting monocyte chemoattractant protein 1/IL-17 driven vascular immune cell infiltration and inflammation. Therefore, the dysbiosis of gut microbiota may have an impact on the development of hypertension.",18546492.0,2736,2742,salt,133.0,137.0,Chemical,174.0,187.0,Lactobacillus,Species,decrease
"Atherosclerosis is the pathological basis of various CVDs, and seriously harms human health. The pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is based on the accumulation of lipids in the intima of the most frequently involved arteries, leading to the proliferation of fibers and calcium deposition, gradually thickening and hardening the walls of blood vessels. This process is closely associated with the inflammatory response. Of note, there is a serious dysbiosis between the composition of gut microbiota and interspecific relationships in individuals with atherosclerosis. And the metabolites of gut microbiota can also further affect atherosclerosis (Fig. 5).",18885516.0,2954,tdljlK-ovx,calcium,267.0,274.0,Chemical,326.0,348.0,walls of blood vessels,Cellline,worsen
