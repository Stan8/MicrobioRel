"The interplay between the microbiome, microbial metabolites, and neuropathological processes present during neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and PD. The microbiome and microbial metabolites could regulate brain homeostasis via four different ways: 1. direct absorption of specific metabolites which have the ability to cross the BBB; 2. interaction between peripheral immune systems, which interact with @Cellline$ @Cellline$ and astrocytes; 3. influence on gut hormones and the enteroendocrine system; 4. communication via the vagus nerve. These four routes may have an influence on pathological symptoms such as increased BBB leakage and neural inflammation, enhanced beta-amyloid and alpha-synuclein formation, and finally neuron loss and motor/cognitive deficits.",Location_of
"Previous results have indicated that the metabolic regulation of BAs may be associated with T2D but the specific changes in BAs and the related mechanisms remain to be studied. It is also unclear how the different types of BAs change in patients with T2D. A study also suggested that patients with @Disease$ had no change in plasma total BAs, but had an increase in DCA and a decrease in @Chemical$ in plasma. Another study found that the plasma total BA concentration in patients with T2D was not significantly different from that of healthy people; however, the concentration of DCA in the plasma of patients with T2D was significantly higher than that of healthy controls. The mechanism may be that FXR and TGR5 are inhibited during insulin resistance, and the most effective natural ligands of the receptors, DCA and CA, are compensatorily increased. Besides, circulating BAs levels including DCA, TCA, TDCA, and glycodeoxycholic acid, are positively associated with the risk of T2D, while taurohyodeoxycholic acid is negatively associated with diabetes. This may be due to the fact that hydrophobic BAs isoforms (such as DCA) have been shown to be involved in inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress with glucose dysregulation, and hydrophilic BAs isoforms (such as tauroursodeoxycholic acid) have been shown to prevent inflammation and enhance insulin sensitivity.",decrease
"In fact, changes in the function of gut microecology and gut microbiota may cause the occurrence and exacerbation of various diseases. It was found that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota may lead to decreased cardiac function and increased cardiomyopathy as well as cardiac insufficiency, which is of great significance in predicting CVDs and also has important predictive significance for the prognosis of adverse cardiovascular events. The gut microbiota has been reported to be associated with CVDs and its corresponding risk factors, such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, and insulin resistance. These risk factors may affect the composition and the diversity of gut microbiota. In addition, gut dysbiosis is also linked to inflammation, oxidative stress, platelet activity, thrombosis and atherosclerosis, which contribute to the progression of CVDs. The possible mechanism of gut microbiota dysbiosis related to CVDs includes its role in increasing intestinal permeability and triggering inflammation via the LPS/TLR4 as well as NLRP3 pathways, thereby ultimately contributing to the development of CVDs. In short, the @Disease$ directly triggers by @Species$is one of the possible mechanisms of CVDs susceptibility, and material metabolism affected by gut microbiota was proposed to play a role as well.",causes
"Schizophrenia is a severe neuropsychological disorder affecting approximately 1% of the world's population. 16S rRNA sequencing and diversity analyses of the fecal-derived microbiota obtained from patients suffering from schizophrenia indicated lower microbiome diversity. Performed analyses revealed the abundance of Proteobacteria and decreased amount of SCFAs synthesizing bacteria from Blautia, Coprococcus, and Roseburia species. It has been reported that butyrate and other SCFAs can cross the gastrointestinal endothelium and can pass through the BBB (exploiting active membrane transporters) and inhibit histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1). Abnormal microbiota can lead to reduced levels of butyrate and can cause the elevation of @Gene$ levels in the prefrontal cortex and @Cellline$ of patients with diagnosed schizophrenia, causing altered DNA methylation, impaired synaptic plasticity and short-term memory, and the development of impaired cognitive function and social abilities.",Location_of
"At present, it is generally believed that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota is an important factor affecting the integrity of the intestinal barrier. Previous studies showed that the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota could lead to the rapid proliferation of intestinal pathogenic bacteria, and the pro-inflammatory factors released by them seriously damaged the structure and function of the intestinal barrier, and it also promoted the occurrence and development of diseases in the digestive system as well as metabolic system. Furthermore, the @Disease$ of the @Species$ triggers intestinal mucosal barrier damage, leading to inflammation and disordered nutrient metabolism. Overactivated inflammation caused by microbiota dysbiosis disrupts normal intestinal mucosal barrier function, and increases intestinal permeability to promote bacterial translocation, leading to endotoxemia and inflammation, thereby increasing the risk of CVDs.",experiences
"Changes in the composition of gut microbiota increase the risk of obesity, including increasing inflammation, insulin resistance, adiposity deposition, and the capability of harvesting energy from food. Obesity is associated with the changes in @Chemical$, mainly including metabolites of SCFAs, BCAAs, and @Chemical$.",part_of
"In summary, the gut microbiota generates a series of bioactive metabolites to interact with host metabolism. These metabolites mainly include SCFAs, primary and secondary BAs, TMAO, and so on. Among these metabolites, some exert synergistic effects to promote host health by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system to control glucose metabolism. For example, SCFAs interact with human hormones such as GLP-1 and PYY to effect energy uptake and the development of obesity. SCFAs are beneficial for regulating appetite and energy intake, and preventing the formation of atherosclerosis. Other metabolites, such as TMAO and phenylacetylglutamine (PAGln), may be toxic. For example, TMAO may be proatherogenic to promote the process of thrombosis and atherosclerosis, thereby increasing the risk of cardiovascular events. Patients with CVDs had lower levels of SCFA generation and higher levels of TMAO production due to the change in gut microbiota. Furthermore, TMAO causes vascular endothelial damage and promotes the production of atherosclerotic plaques. TMAO can also increase the release of intracellular calcium ions, enhance the reactivity of platelets, and increase the risk of thrombosis to increase CVDs susceptibility. Besides, @Chemical$ enhances platelet reactivity and thrombosis, leading to @Disease$. Taken together, mounting evidence suggests that changes in gut microbiota metabolites are part of the crucial mechanisms by which the gut microbiota regulates the occurrence and development of CVDs.",causes
"Alzheimer's disease (AD), commonly known as senile dementia, is a chronic, devastating, neurodegenerative, and neuroinflammatory disorder with rising incidence and is considered to be the most frequent form of dementia in aging individuals (caused by aberrant protein processing, trafficking, and aggregation in neural cells). The World Alzheimer Report indicates that 50 million people suffer from AD-related neurological problems and this number will increase to 152 million in 2050. It is predicted that in 2030 up to 66 million people will suffer from AD. AD is a multifactorial disease characterized by synapse loss, extracellular cerebral accumulation of insoluble peptides belonging to amyloid-beta (Abeta), the aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein inside the cells, neurofibrillary mass formation, neuronal death (in the neocortex and hippocampus), progressive memory deterioration, and cognition decline leading to dementia. AD is associated with more than 700 genetic and environmental risk factors. From the genetic point of view, one of the most important risk factors related to @Disease$ development is the incidence of a ""4 allele variant in the apolipoprotein"" (@Gene$) gene, which is associated with cholesterol transport in CNS, and also contributes to metabolomic and taxonomic changes in the microbiome.",Associated_with
"Multiple sclerosis is a chronic neurodegenerative autoimmune disorder, where the human immune system attacks the myelin sheath surrounding axon terminals, thereby triggering long-lasting inflammation within the CNS, abrasion formation, and demyelination of axons. Besides, afterward, it can cause autonomic and cognitive problems, motor, sensory, and visual flaws, and finally paralysis and disruption of the BBB. Various animal and human studies suggested the participation of gut microbiota in the development of MS. Animal studies on an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mice model revealed a significant reduction in Lactobacillus phyla, contributing to an impairment of the mice's immune systems. In patients diagnosed with MS, a reduction in the variety and quantity of gut bacteria was detected, confirming a moderate @Disease$ state.

"It is well investigated that BCAAs have a significant positive correlation with blood glucose, blood lipids, and the insulin resistance index, and can be used as potential biomarkers for the early prediction of diabetes. One study indicated that three BCAAs (leucine, isoleucine, and valine), and two aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine and tyrosine) were significantly increased 10 years before the onset of diabetes. The increased BCAAs-induced insulin resistance was associated with the presence of @Species$ and @Species$. The major groups of gut bacteria that biosynthesize BCAAs are Prevotella copri and Bacteroides vulgatus, and the insulin resistance caused by elevated BCAAs levels is associated with the presence of these two bacteria. Of note, feeding Prevotella to mice indicated that Prevotella could induce insulin resistance, resulting in increased BCAAs levels as well as glucose intolerance.",None

"However host-microbiota interplay is not exclusively restricted to cell-cell interactions. Intestinal microbes are capable of producing a plethora of different types of compounds, i.e., small molecules (amino acids, neurotransmitters, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and other fatty acid derivatives, indoles, vitamins, and cofactors), polysaccharides, and proteins (i.e., bacteriocins), which have been reported as important factors in shaping the bacterial community and modulation of the immune system. It has been demonstrated that intestinal bacterial strains such as @Species$ or Lactobacillus spp. interact directly with the host's CNS (central nervous system), as they can release neurotransmitters such as dopamine, noradrenaline, histamine, acetylcholine, GABA (@Chemical$), or serotonin. This metabolic status of the microbiome is also vulnerable to dysbiosis and compositional changes and often leads to metabolic disturbances. For example, dysbiosis can induce elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, intensifying oxidative stress and neuronal inflammatory processes. It has been estimated that 40% of the metabolites detected in humans are the products of bacterial metabolism, which plays a fundamental role in the modulation of the host's physiological processes, including immune-mediated neurodegeneration or affecting neural cell metabolism.",start
"Similar to the AD case, the host metabolome is affected during disease, which is not without its influence on microbiome composition/metabolome. Bile acid synthesis is a common part of the metabolic system which is affected both in AD and PD. Regarding this, there were increased levels of bile acids conjugated with taurine (taurodeoxycholic, @Chemical$, and taurochenodeoxycholic acid) observed, which correlates with motor activity in @Chemical$. It is worth underlining the role of taurine as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Moreover, it is fabricated and secreted by neurons during stress conditions, e.g., mitochondrial dysfunctions, where taurine seems to increase the neuronal survival rate due to calcium influx regulation and the intensified antioxidant gene expression. In summary, taurine demonstrates an important role in proper brain function and development. Additionally, it contributes to the volume regulation of brain cells, and interferes with synaptic amino acid receptors.",increase
"Aromatic amino acids including tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine are metabolized into indole and @Chemical$ by certain intestinal @Species$, such as Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, and Peptostreptococcus. Tryptophan is decomposed into indole, indoleacetic acid, indole-3-lactic acid, 3-methylindole (skatole) and other indole compounds under the action of tryptophanase. Tryptophanase is the key enzyme that generates indole. The activity of the enzyme is easily induced by the substrate tryptophan, so when the amount of tryptophan changes in the colonic environment, the content of indole will fluctuate greatly. Of note, the metabolic products of aromatic amino acids generated by gut microbiota have a great impact on the pathology of cardiometabolic diseases. For example, indole propionic acid is associated with insulin sensitivity and appears to reduce the risk of diabetes. Moreover, the gut microbiota metabolizes dietary tryptophan to indoxyl, which further generates indoxyl sulfate through sulfonation. Excessive accumulation of indoxyl sulfate causes cardiomyocyte damage and increases thrombus formation. Another phenol compound, 4-methylphenol, can inhibit the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into mature adipocytes, induce apoptosis and reduce glucose uptake. In addition, benzoic acid is an aromatic carboxylic acid synthesized by colonic microorganisms by metabolizing dietary aromatic compounds. Plasma benzoic acid levels were found to be elevated in the rat model of polygenic diabetes.",start
"Experimental research confirms the hypothesis regarding SCFA reduction in autoimmune diseases (MS among others) and altered gut microbiota. A low level of SCFAs dysregulates Treg cell functions, leading to insufficient immune tolerance towards endogenous components and enteric microbiota. However, this process can be reversed by SCFAs supplementation (e.g., propionic acid). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing NFkappaB activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation and on microglial cells in vitro. TUDCA binds to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) expressed in microglial cells. This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS). Experimental results demonstrated that TUDCA acted as a double-edged sword, triggering microglia enhancement in anti-inflammatory and alternatively activated markers and on the other hand reducing the infiltration of macrophages and microglia with expressed pro-inflammatory markers. Interestingly, during neuroinflammation, microglial cells change their morphology, converting themselves into reactive macrophage-like forms. However, microglial cells are flexible, as they can sometimes polarize towards alternatively activated phenotypes, promoting CNS pathologies (proinflammatory or M1 microglia), or exert anti-inflammatory effects, boosting cell repair and remodeling. Bile acids were identified as nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor agonists, leading to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) depletion (in a mouse model) and neuroinflammatory process adjustment. The administration of the complex probiotic positively influenced the intestinal flora balance in patients diagnosed with MS. The probiotic prevented the onset of dysbiosis, significantly increasing the amount of Methanobrevibacter and Akkermansia, Prevotella, and Sutterella in @Disease$ @Species$, influencing gene expression and the production of beneficial bacterial metabolites.",experiences

"Recently, bacterial strains producing SCFAs have gained extreme popularity. SCFAs are small organic monocarboxylic acids, released after the fermentation of indigestible alimentary fiber (mainly galacto- or fructooligosaccharides), plant-derived polysaccharides, or the metabolism of amino acids, and are considered a key gut-derived metabolites with beneficial health effects and as essential in gut-brain crosstalk. The type of formed SCFAs is correlated with the kind of fiber ingested and the overall gut microbiota population. For example, microbes belonging to Firmicutes phyla (e.g., Lachnospiraceae, Eubacterium, or Roseburia belonging to the Clostridia class) are responsible for the main production of butyrate, whereas Bifidobacteria spp. produce lactate and acetate. SCFAs are significantly reduced during dysbiosis, where disrupted gut epithelial integrity, inflammation, and altered microbiome metabolic processes occur. In a healthy colon, levels of SCFAs can vary depending on a diet; however, in multiple diseases, these levels are altered. @Chemical$ may also act in an indirect or direct way through G-protein-coupled receptors or as @Chemical$. They participate in various physiological processes, such as cell energetics and colonocyte metabolism and skeletal, adipose, and liver tissue modulation.

"Trillions of microorganisms colonize the anaerobic and nutritious environment in the gut to form a healthy intestinal physiological ecosystem. These communities are regarded as ""gut microbiota"", and the sum total of all microorganism genomes in the gut, including their DNA sequences and other genetic information, are together called ""gut microbiomes"". Most intestinal microbial communities in the human intestinal tract are bacteria with complex structures. There are more than 1,000 species of intestinal bacteria, and the number reaches approximately 1014. The ratio of bacterial number to human cell number ranged from 10:1 to 1:1. It also contains 100-fold more genes than our own genome, which is called the second genome of the human body. In terms of the types of intestinal bacteria, the gut microbiota is mainly composed of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, and this composition is relatively stable in healthy individuals but not in patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) or other diseases. Among those @Species$, @Species$ and Bacteroidetes in the large intestine account for about 90% of the total number of gut microbiota, and the ratio is a vital health indicator reflecting the condition of health and is also associated with the incidence of CVDs.

"In the past decade, single dietary factors which can positively manipulate the gut microbiota-brain axis through microbiome modulation have gained significant attention. One of these factors is probiotic bacteria and/or prebiotics. Probiotics are defined as microbial organisms with a beneficial role in the host's health and homeostasis, which help to preserve digestive, metabolic, immune, and neuroendocrine functions. Naturally probiotic bacteria can be found in fermented food. Experimental results revealed that the administration of @Species$ alone or in combination with prebiotics (fructooligosaccharides or galactooligosaccharides) improved the @Cellline$, which is the first line of ""defence"" from harmful factors occurring in food, and the microbiome. Probiotics and prebiotics are well-documented ""problem-solution"" for gastrointestinal diseases. Moreover, probiotics can reduce CNS inflammatory processes and activation of microglia, demonstrating promising potential for use in neurodegenerative diseases as ingestible ""psychobiotics"". Many studies indicate that the ingestion of probiotics can serve as a microbiological strategy against neurodegenerative diseases such as AD; however, the exact mechanism is under investigation. Experiments performed on mice underline the hypothesis that mechanisms related to neuroprotective effects of Bifidobacterium breve administration may be connected with neuroinflammation and cognition pathways, probably through the production of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) neurotransmitter and the regulation of the gut microbial composition. Clinical results of a randomized double-blind controlled trial revealed that 3-month exposure to Lactobacillus spp. And a Bifidobacterium bifidum ""cocktail"" enhanced cognitive functions and memory, as examined in a mini-mental state test.

"The PD microbiome has a diminished variety of bacterial taxonomic groups, especially the ones associated with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects and the increase of phyla, which has toxic effects. Predominantly, the reduction was observed in the Lachnospiraceae family, including Butyrivibrio, Pseudobutyrivibrio, @Species$, Blautia and SCFAs-producing Prevotellaceae. The increased amount of Enterobacteriaceae is linked to the severity of postural instability and walking difficulties. Moreover, the PD microbiome is characterised by increased Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium species and decreased amount of Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae. The overgrowth of Akkermansia spp. in PD patients may be strain-specific and can be related to immune-response alterations, decreased mucus thicknesses, and increased constipation. Faecalibacterium family is a crucial player producing SCFAs and anti-inflammatory metabolites, maintaining gut health. Faecalibacterium balance disturbances can lead to impaired gut-barrier function, increasing the risk of infection with enteric pathogens and boosting alpha-synuclein formation. Similarly, the Lachnospiraceae family can produce butyrate, important for the proper function of the gut epithelium. Decreased Lachnospiraceae quantity might aggravate gut inflammation, stimulate toxin production, and damage the integrity of the gut epithelial barrier. PD patients' intestinal microflora were characterised by a diminished abundance of Lachnospiraceae, which was positively correlated with PD progress, cognitive decline, and impaired motor functions. These microbiome's compositional changes correlate well with some metabolic switches. PD microbiota show reduced SCFAs production, decreased @Chemical$, and augmented proteolytic fermentation. Chen et al. demonstrated that the SCFA level was relevant to microbiota composition changes and the clinical severity of PD. The levels of SCFAs acetate, butyrate, and propionate in fecal samples of PD patients were significantly reduced, contrary to their elevated concentration in plasma. Rodent models of PD disease have shown a positive effect of SCFAs on behavior and PD symptoms. Butyrate, as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, exerts neuroprotective activity, reducing dopaminergic cell death, and motor impairment, and improving cognitive functions. Taken together, SCFAs play an important role in protection from PD disease and could be proposed as representative gut-oriented indicators for diversifying individuals with PD and placing disease progression.",None
"It remains unclear how the gut microbiota and @Chemical$ profiles interact with each other and whether the interaction is associated with @Disease$.

For example, the increased BAs are the main reason for the marked increase in the abundance of the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. Another study has shown that BAs and a high-fat diet promote the growth of Bilophila wadsworthia in mice, and secondary BAs produced by Bilophila spp. have been shown to induce obesity. What's more, it has been reported that the low capacity of microbiota to metabolize Tauro-beta-muricholic acid, a primary BA, might increase the risk of obesity and insulin resistance.

Preclinical tests on genetically modified mice with PD demonstrated the correlation between Akkermansia muciniphila and Bilophila wadsworthia abundance and decreased the mice motor activity.

"Experimental research confirms the hypothesis regarding SCFA reduction in autoimmune diseases (MS among others) and altered gut microbiota. A low level of SCFAs dysregulates Treg cell functions, leading to insufficient immune tolerance towards endogenous components and enteric microbiota. However, this process can be reversed by SCFAs supplementation (e.g., propionic acid). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing NFkappaB activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation and on microglial cells in vitro. TUDCA binds to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (@Species$/@Species$) expressed in microglial cells. This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS). Experimental results demonstrated that TUDCA acted as a double-edged sword, triggering microglia enhancement in anti-inflammatory and alternatively activated markers and on the other hand reducing the infiltration of macrophages and microglia with expressed pro-inflammatory markers. Interestingly, during neuroinflammation, microglial cells change their morphology, converting themselves into reactive macrophage-like forms. However, microglial cells are flexible, as they can sometimes polarize towards alternatively activated phenotypes, promoting CNS pathologies (proinflammatory or M1 microglia), or exert anti-inflammatory effects, boosting cell repair and remodeling. Bile acids were identified as nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor agonists, leading to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) depletion (in a mouse model) and neuroinflammatory process adjustment. The administration of the complex probiotic positively influenced the intestinal flora balance in patients diagnosed with MS. The probiotic prevented the onset of dysbiosis, significantly increasing the amount of Methanobrevibacter and Akkermansia, Prevotella, and Sutterella in MS patients, influencing gene expression and the production of beneficial bacterial metabolites.",Interacts_with

"Insufficient dietary fiber intake is considered to be an important risk factor for diabetes. The decrease in the production of SCFAs counts for an important reason here. Modulation of dietary SCFAs is thought to reshape the gut microbiota in diabetes and ameliorate diabetes. SCFAs increase fatty acid oxidation and energy expenditure to decrease the risk of suffering from T2D. Of note, T2D patients have lower levels of butyrate-generating bacteria. Butyrate could promote the secretion of postprandial insulin; and the increase in fecal propionic acid was associated with an increase in T2D risk. In oral glucose tolerance test, a high butyrate-producing microbiota was associated with an improved insulin response (indicating improved beta-cell function), and butyrate concentration was directly related to postprandial insulin sensitivity.

For example, one of the most important commensal microbes in the human gut is Bifidobacterium, a strictly anaerobic gram-positive bacterium, which assists the human body in the digestion and absorption of nutrients, resists the invasion of harmful bacteria, improves the immune function of the body, secretes molecules to regulate immune function, and participates in the metabolism of substances in the intestine. Besides, another common commensal microbe, A. muciniphila, a gram-positive bacterium, reduces insulin sensitivity and is inversely associated with the development of obesity and diabetes.

The Role of @Species$ in @Species$ Obesity: Recent Findings and Future Perspectives,None
"Previous results have indicated that the metabolic regulation of BAs may be associated with T2D but the specific changes in BAs and the related mechanisms remain to be studied. It is also unclear how the different types of BAs change in patients with T2D. A study also suggested that patients with T2D had no change in plasma total BAs, but had an increase in DCA and a decrease in CDCA in plasma. Another study found that the plasma total BA concentration in patients with T2D was not significantly different from that of healthy people; however, the concentration of DCA in the plasma of patients with T2D was significantly higher than that of healthy controls. The mechanism may be that FXR and TGR5 are inhibited during insulin resistance, and the most effective natural ligands of the receptors, DCA and CA, are compensatorily increased. Besides, circulating BAs levels including DCA, TCA, TDCA, and glycodeoxycholic acid, are positively associated with the risk of T2D, while taurohyodeoxycholic acid is negatively associated with diabetes. This may be due to the fact that hydrophobic BAs isoforms (such as @Chemical$) have been shown to be involved in @Disease$ and endoplasmic reticulum stress with glucose dysregulation, and hydrophilic BAs isoforms (such as tauroursodeoxycholic acid) have been shown to prevent inflammation and enhance insulin sensitivity.",affects

A positive correlation between polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (N-3 PUFA), and alpha-linolenic acid (aLNA) ingestion and protection against PD development in dose-response trends was demonstrated. American studies demonstrated that PUFA replacement with increased @Chemical$ intake (Western Diet) significantly increased the risk of @Disease$ in males only.

Moreover, sex differences are implicated in the mental health and prevalence of psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, and neurodegenerative disorders. It has been demonstrated that PD patients usually have altered microbiome compositions compared with controls. Similar to AD, many sex differences in PD are correlated with the protective nature of estrogens, as they are impacted by the gut-brain axis and protect against oxidative damage, thereby supporting dopaminergic function. It has been demonstrated that at age 45, the estimated overall lifetime risk for AD is about 20% for females and 10% for males, which is followed by a disruption in the patient's gut microbiota composition.

There are more than 1,000 species of intestinal bacteria, and the number reaches approximately 1014. The ratio of bacterial number to human cell number ranged from 10:1 to 1:1. It also contains 100-fold more genes than our own genome, which is called the second genome of the human body. In terms of the types of intestinal bacteria, the gut microbiota is mainly composed of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, and this composition is relatively stable in healthy individuals but not in @Species$ with cardiovascular diseases (@Disease$) or other diseases. Among those gut microbiota, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in the large intestine account for about 90% of the total number of gut microbiota, and the ratio is a vital health indicator reflecting the condition of health and is also associated with the incidence of CVDs. In addition, the gut microbiota maintains a symbiotic or antagonistic relationship with its host to form a dynamic and balanced microbial system.",experiences
"The gut microbiota can affect the occurrence of diabetes by affecting the composition and metabolism of BAs, as well as their binding to FXR and TGR5 receptors. An excess of @Chemical$ produced by dysregulated @Species$ can stimulate intestinal parietal cells to secrete a large amount of serotonin, thereby increasing blood glucose levels. In patients with diabetes, changes in gut microbiota composition may alter the ratio of primary BAs to secondary BAs. However, from the impaired fasting glucose level to impaired glucose tolerance, and finally to T2D, the specific changes in gut microbiota and BAs pools at different stages of this process have not been fully studied.",start

"It is currently controversial whether supplementation with BCAAs would increase circulating BCAAs, thereby increasing the risk of diabetes. And reducing BCAAs intake promotes fat mass loss and insulin sensitivity in mice with obesity. A high BCAAs diet causes excessive feeding, mainly due to excessive appetite. Adding threonine to balance the composition of amino acids in the diet can inhibit food intake. Nevertheless, some studies have found that supplementary BCAAs, such as isoleucine and @Chemical$, can improve insulin resistance and reduce weight to lower the risk of @Disease$ and diabetes. The inconsistency may be due to the individual state of energy excess or energy deficiency. In terms of an excessive energy state, such as in patients with obesity or diabetes who have an impaired ability to degrade BCAAs, BCAAs and related metabolites accumulate in circulation to reduce insulin sensitivity and cause insulin resistance. In most elderly people with inadequate energy or athletes who maintain good fitness habits, BCAAs can improve the form of metabolism. In these people, BCAAs decomposition metabolism is increased by regulatory factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha coactivator (PGC-1alpha) and PPARalpha, so that BCAAs levels are maintained in a steady state, which ultimately promotes glucose intake and insulin sensitivity. This was supported by the study of Newgard, who pointed out that dietary intake of BCAAs might interact with a high-fat diet to induce abnormal metabolic phenotypes such as insulin resistance. Mice fed BCAAs alone did not develop insulin resistance. However, when mice were fed a high-fat diet supplemented with BCAAs, they developed insulin resistance. This study suggested that BCAAs only lead to insulin resistance in the presence of excess energy intake. Therefore, more studies are needed to explore the supplementation with BCAAs and insulin resistance as well as the development of cardiovascular risk factors.",prevents

Huntington's disease has genetic origins related to trinucleotide expansion (CAG) in the huntingtin coding gene. Moreover, experiments performed in mice models revealed that the altered microbiota observed in the HD-suffering individuals at the pre-motor symptomatic stage highly influence health status. HD microbiota composition indicated dysbiosis, disturbances in cytokine levels, and an increase in sulphur metabolism characterized by hydrogen sulphide overproduction and negatively influencing gut health. Ultimately, the gut dysbiosis state was also described in a transgenic mice model representing Huntington's disease.

"At the end of this chapter, it is worth mentioning the fact that the interaction between the microbiome and the host is bidirectional, and some metabolic changes, which could be a pathological result of disease progression, also influence microbiome metabolism. A good example is a disturbance in cholesterol homeostasis, which correlates with an augmented probability of Alzheimer's disease occurrence. In addition, alteration of the intestinal microbiota composition with the subsequent fluctuations in the serum and brain levels of bile acids (BAs) is involved in the development of AD. BAs can act as detergents, affecting BBB permeability, and incrementing brain influx of peripheral cholesterol and BAs. Therefore, proper cholesterol elimination pathways play a crucial role in AD prevention and treatment. The gut microbiome is a main ""organ"" metabolizing secondary bile acids. Peripheral @Chemical$ is eliminated mainly through its @Cellline$ conversion to BAs. The gut microbiota performs BA transformation via deconjugation and dehydroxylation, leading to secondary BA formation. Nho et al. investigated the correlation between neurodegeneration and BAs, B-amyloid, and tau protein concentration. The application of targeted metabolomics enabled the determination of the association between intestinal microbiota-derived secondary bile acids and sera BAs. Interestingly, the analysis indicated an imbalanced BA ratio, underlying an increased amount of secondary BAs over primary ones. Another clinical study confirmed the correlation between bile acid metabolic profile and the prevalence of AD and mild cognitive impairment, showing similar BA ratio disruptions. Decreased cognitive functions were positively associated with increased concentrations of secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid, and glycolithocholic acid.

Naturally probiotic bacteria can be found in fermented food. Experimental results revealed that the administration of probiotics alone or in combination with @Chemical$ (@Chemical$ or galactooligosaccharides) improved the gastrointestinal barrier, which is the first line of ""defence"" from harmful factors occurring in food, and the microbiome.

Many studies indicate that the ingestion of probiotics can serve as a microbiological strategy against neurodegenerative diseases such as AD; however, the exact mechanism is under investigation. Experiments performed on mice underline the hypothesis that mechanisms related to neuroprotective effects of Bifidobacterium breve administration may be connected with neuroinflammation and cognition pathways, probably through the production of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) neurotransmitter and the regulation of the gut microbial composition.

Of note, the metabolic products of aromatic amino acids generated by gut microbiota have a great impact on the pathology of cardiometabolic diseases. For example, indole propionic acid is associated with insulin sensitivity and appears to reduce the risk of diabetes. Moreover, the gut microbiota metabolizes dietary tryptophan to indoxyl, which further generates indoxyl sulfate through sulfonation. Excessive accumulation of indoxyl sulfate causes cardiomyocyte damage and increases thrombus formation. Another phenol compound, 4-methylphenol, can inhibit the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into mature adipocytes, induce apoptosis and reduce glucose uptake.

BAs are excreted into the intestine to aid in the digestion and absorption of lipids and combine with farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and takeda-G-protein receptor 5 (TGR5) (Fig. 2). There is a strong biochemical relationship between BAs and gut microbiota.

For example, indole propionic acid is associated with insulin sensitivity and appears to reduce the risk of diabetes. Moreover, the gut microbiota metabolizes dietary tryptophan to indoxyl, which further generates indoxyl sulfate through sulfonation. Excessive accumulation of indoxyl sulfate causes cardiomyocyte damage and increases thrombus formation. Another phenol compound, 4-methylphenol, can inhibit the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into mature adipocytes, induce apoptosis and reduce glucose uptake.

Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing NFkappaB activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation and on microglial cells in vitro. TUDCA binds to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) expressed in microglial cells.

Predominantly, the reduction was observed in the Lachnospiraceae family, including Butyrivibrio, Pseudobutyrivibrio, Coprococcus, Blautia and SCFAs-producing Prevotellaceae. The increased amount of Enterobacteriaceae is linked to the severity of postural instability and walking difficulties. Moreover, the PD microbiome is characterised by increased Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium species and decreased amount of Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae. The overgrowth of Akkermansia spp. in PD patients may be strain-specific and can be related to immune-response alterations, decreased mucus thicknesses, and increased constipation. Faecalibacterium family is a crucial player producing SCFAs and anti-inflammatory metabolites, maintaining gut health. Faecalibacterium balance disturbances can lead to impaired gut-barrier function, increasing the risk of infection with enteric pathogens and boosting alpha-synuclein formation. Similarly, the Lachnospiraceae family can produce butyrate, important for the proper function of the gut epithelium. Decreased @Species$ quantity might aggravate gut @Disease$, stimulate toxin production, and damage the integrity of the gut epithelial barrier. PD patients' intestinal microflora were characterised by a diminished abundance of Lachnospiraceae, which was positively correlated with PD progress, cognitive decline, and impaired motor functions. These microbiome's compositional changes correlate well with some metabolic switches. PD microbiota show reduced SCFAs production, decreased carbohydrate fermentation, and augmented proteolytic fermentation. Chen et al. demonstrated that the SCFA level was relevant to microbiota composition changes and the clinical severity of PD. The levels of SCFAs acetate, butyrate, and propionate in fecal samples of PD patients were significantly reduced, contrary to their elevated concentration in plasma. Rodent models of PD disease have shown a positive effect of SCFAs on behavior and PD symptoms. Butyrate, as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, exerts neuroprotective activity, reducing dopaminergic cell death, and motor impairment, and improving cognitive functions. Taken together, SCFAs play an important role in protection from PD disease and could be proposed as representative gut-oriented indicators for diversifying individuals with PD and placing disease progression.",Negative_correlation

"It is currently controversial whether supplementation with BCAAs would increase circulating BCAAs, thereby increasing the risk of diabetes. And reducing BCAAs intake promotes fat mass loss and insulin sensitivity in mice with obesity. A high BCAAs diet causes excessive feeding, mainly due to excessive appetite. Adding threonine to balance the composition of amino acids in the diet can inhibit food intake. Nevertheless, some studies have found that supplementary @Chemical$, such as @Chemical$ and leucine, can improve insulin resistance and reduce weight to lower the risk of obesity and diabetes. The inconsistency may be due to the individual state of energy excess or energy deficiency. In terms of an excessive energy state, such as in patients with obesity or diabetes who have an impaired ability to degrade BCAAs, BCAAs and related metabolites accumulate in circulation to reduce insulin sensitivity and cause insulin resistance. In most elderly people with inadequate energy or athletes who maintain good fitness habits, BCAAs can improve the form of metabolism. In these people, BCAAs decomposition metabolism is increased by regulatory factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha coactivator (PGC-1alpha) and PPARalpha, so that BCAAs levels are maintained in a steady state, which ultimately promotes glucose intake and insulin sensitivity. This was supported by the study of Newgard, who pointed out that dietary intake of BCAAs might interact with a high-fat diet to induce abnormal metabolic phenotypes such as insulin resistance. Mice fed BCAAs alone did not develop insulin resistance. However, when mice were fed a high-fat diet supplemented with BCAAs, they developed insulin resistance. This study suggested that BCAAs only lead to insulin resistance in the presence of excess energy intake. Therefore, more studies are needed to explore the supplementation with BCAAs and insulin resistance as well as the development of cardiovascular risk factors.",part_of

"BAs, as by-products of cholesterol metabolism, are the main organic component of bile and are synthesized in hepatocytes. Cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) are primary BAs directly synthesized from cholesterol; secondary BAs include deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholic acid (LCA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and their glycine and taurine conjugated forms. BAs are excreted into the intestine to aid in the digestion and absorption of lipids and combine with farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and takeda-G-protein receptor 5 (TGR5) (Fig. 2). There is a strong biochemical relationship between BAs and gut microbiota.

"Given that the gut microbiota is essential in human health, changes in the composition and function of the gut microbiota may result in the development of diseases. Due to the influence of host genes, diet, antibiotic use, lifestyle, drugs as well as other factors, the composition and diversity of gut microbiota gradually change with interindividual variation. For example, a high-fat diet leads to an increase in the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. When the composition and proportion of gut microbiota change, inflammation and metabolic abnormalities can be induced, which contribute to the development of different diseases. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota refers to changes in the number, species and composition of gut microbiota. In recent years, @Disease$ has been shown to be critically involved in health and has emerged as a potential pathogenesis for various diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, cancers, and CVDs. Moreover, gut dysbiosis is also a driver of metabolic inflammation and @Disease$, which serve as a key feature of metabolic diseases.

"At the end of this chapter, it is worth mentioning the fact that the interaction between the microbiome and the host is bidirectional, and some metabolic changes, which could be a pathological result of disease progression, also influence microbiome metabolism. A good example is a disturbance in cholesterol homeostasis, which correlates with an augmented probability of Alzheimer's disease occurrence. In addition, alteration of the intestinal microbiota composition with the subsequent fluctuations in the serum and brain levels of bile acids (BAs) is involved in the development of AD. BAs can act as detergents, affecting BBB permeability, and incrementing brain influx of peripheral cholesterol and BAs. Therefore, proper cholesterol elimination pathways play a crucial role in AD prevention and treatment. The gut microbiome is a main ""organ"" metabolizing secondary @Chemical$. Peripheral cholesterol is eliminated mainly through its liver conversion to BAs. The gut microbiota performs BA transformation via deconjugation and dehydroxylation, leading to secondary BA formation. Nho et al. investigated the correlation between neurodegeneration and BAs, B-amyloid, and tau protein concentration. The application of targeted metabolomics enabled the determination of the association between intestinal microbiota-derived secondary bile acids and sera BAs. Interestingly, the analysis indicated an imbalanced BA ratio, underlying an increased amount of secondary BAs over primary ones. Another clinical study confirmed the correlation between bile acid metabolic profile and the prevalence of @Disease$ and mild cognitive impairment, showing similar BA ratio disruptions. Decreased cognitive functions were positively associated with increased concentrations of secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid, and glycolithocholic acid. The described results suggested the involvement of the pathological gut microbiota in AD development; however, still it requires more in-depth studies.",None
"It remains unclear how the gut microbiota and BAs profiles interact with each other and whether the interaction is associated with obesity. @Species$ fed BAs exhibited obesity and a composition change in the obesity-associated gut microbiota, which is similar to high-fat diet-fed mice. Under a high-fat diet, the concentration of intestinal BAs increases, and the composition of gut microbiota alternates. For example, the increased BAs are the main reason for the marked increase in the abundance of the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. Another study has shown that BAs and a high-fat diet promote the growth of Bilophila wadsworthia in mice, and secondary BAs produced by Bilophila spp. have been shown to induce obesity. What's more, it has been reported that the low capacity of microbiota to metabolize Tauro-beta-muricholic acid, a primary BA, might increase the risk of obesity and insulin resistance. Therefore, BAs profiles affect the composition of gut microbiota, and gut microbiota also regulates the production and ratio of different BAs to play an important role in @Disease$ susceptibility.",None
"BAs, as by-products of cholesterol metabolism, are the main organic component of bile and are synthesized in hepatocytes. Cholic acid (@Chemical$) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) are @Chemical$ directly synthesized from cholesterol; secondary BAs include deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholic acid (LCA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and their glycine and taurine conjugated forms. BAs are excreted into the intestine to aid in the digestion and absorption of lipids and combine with farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and takeda-G-protein receptor 5 (TGR5) (Fig. 2). There is a strong biochemical relationship between BAs and gut microbiota. Some gut microbiota in healthy people can convert conjugated BAs into free BAs, and can transform BAs into secondary BAs with the help of bile salt hydrolase (BSH) and cholesterol 7-alpha hydroxy-lase (CYP7A1), so as to reduce blood cholesterol by affecting the enterohepatic circulation of BAs. Besides, the gut microbiota affects the metabolism of BAs by regulating the activity of BSH to reduce LDL cholesterol levels. BAs have bacteriostatic properties and an antimicrobial effect. BAs destroy the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane and thereby change the intestinal microecology. BAs also prevent bacteria from overgrowth and decrease inflammation. More importantly, BAs are also closely associated with CVDs. For example, BAs levels in the feces of patients with CVDs are different from those in healthy individuals. And BAs have been reported to regulate vascular tension and affect ion exchange on cardiomyocyte membranes, suggesting that regulating BAs by gut microbiota might be a treatment for CVDs.",part_of

"Importantly, studies found that the occurrence of CVDs was also involved in the immune response mediated by the NLR family.

Moreover, the peptidoglycan components in bacteria can bind to NOD1 and NOD2, which in turn mediate the occurrence of the inflammatory response, and further leads to atherosclerosis. Besides, inflammation induced by the NLRP3 inflammasome plays a role in the interaction between gut microbiota and cardiometabolic diseases.

The increased amount of Enterobacteriaceae is linked to the severity of postural instability and walking difficulties. Moreover, the PD microbiome is characterised by increased Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium species and decreased amount of Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae. The overgrowth of Akkermansia spp. in PD patients may be strain-specific and can be related to immune-response alterations, decreased mucus thicknesses, and increased constipation. Faecalibacterium family is a crucial player producing SCFAs and anti-inflammatory metabolites, maintaining gut health. @Species$ balance disturbances can lead to @Disease$, increasing the risk of infection with enteric pathogens and boosting alpha-synuclein formation. Similarly, the Lachnospiraceae family can produce butyrate, important for the proper function of the gut epithelium. Decreased Lachnospiraceae quantity might aggravate gut inflammation, stimulate toxin production, and damage the integrity of the gut epithelial barrier. PD patients' intestinal microflora were characterised by a diminished abundance of Lachnospiraceae, which was positively correlated with PD progress, cognitive decline, and impaired motor functions. These microbiome's compositional changes correlate well with some metabolic switches. PD microbiota show reduced SCFAs production, decreased carbohydrate fermentation, and augmented proteolytic fermentation. Chen et al. demonstrated that the SCFA level was relevant to microbiota composition changes and the clinical severity of PD. The levels of SCFAs acetate, butyrate, and propionate in fecal samples of PD patients were significantly reduced, contrary to their elevated concentration in plasma. Rodent models of PD disease have shown a positive effect of SCFAs on behavior and PD symptoms. Butyrate, as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, exerts neuroprotective activity, reducing dopaminergic cell death, and motor impairment, and improving cognitive functions. Taken together, SCFAs play an important role in protection from PD disease and could be proposed as representative gut-oriented indicators for diversifying individuals with PD and placing disease progression.",causes

A positive correlation between polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (N-3 PUFA), and alpha-linolenic acid (aLNA) ingestion and protection against PD development in dose-response trends was demonstrated. American studies demonstrated that PUFA replacement with increased animal fat intake (Western Diet) significantly increased the risk of PD in males only. Excessive animal fat intake can promote dysbiosis and the production of harmful microbial metabolites, which can increase the prevalence of the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, sex differences are implicated in the mental health and prevalence of psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, and neurodegenerative disorders. It has been demonstrated that @Disease$ @Species$ usually have altered microbiome compositions compared with controls.

Besides, circulating BAs levels including DCA, TCA, TDCA, and glycodeoxycholic acid, are positively associated with the risk of T2D, while taurohyodeoxycholic acid is negatively associated with diabetes.

"BAs, as by-products of cholesterol metabolism, are the main organic component of bile and are synthesized in hepatocytes. Cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) are primary BAs directly synthesized from cholesterol; secondary BAs include deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholic acid (LCA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and their glycine and taurine conjugated forms. BAs are excreted into the intestine to aid in the digestion and absorption of lipids and combine with farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and takeda-G-protein receptor 5 (TGR5) (Fig. 2). There is a strong biochemical relationship between BAs and gut microbiota.

"The PD microbiome has a diminished variety of bacterial taxonomic groups, especially the ones associated with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects and the increase of phyla, which has toxic effects. Predominantly, the reduction was observed in the Lachnospiraceae family, including Butyrivibrio, Pseudobutyrivibrio, Coprococcus, Blautia and SCFAs-producing Prevotellaceae. The increased amount of Enterobacteriaceae is linked to the severity of postural instability and walking difficulties. Moreover, the PD microbiome is characterised by increased Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium species and decreased amount of Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae. The overgrowth of Akkermansia spp. in PD patients may be strain-specific and can be related to immune-response alterations, decreased mucus thicknesses, and increased constipation. Faecalibacterium family is a crucial player producing SCFAs and anti-inflammatory metabolites, maintaining gut health. Faecalibacterium balance disturbances can lead to impaired gut-barrier function, increasing the risk of infection with enteric pathogens and boosting alpha-synuclein formation. Similarly, the Lachnospiraceae family can produce butyrate, important for the proper function of the gut epithelium. Decreased @Species$ quantity might aggravate gut inflammation, stimulate toxin production, and damage the integrity of the @Cellline$. PD patients' intestinal microflora were characterised by a diminished abundance of Lachnospiraceae, which was positively correlated with PD progress, cognitive decline, and impaired motor functions. These microbiome's compositional changes correlate well with some metabolic switches. PD microbiota show reduced SCFAs production, decreased carbohydrate fermentation, and augmented proteolytic fermentation. Chen et al. demonstrated that the SCFA level was relevant to microbiota composition changes and the clinical severity of PD. The levels of SCFAs acetate, butyrate, and propionate in fecal samples of PD patients were significantly reduced, contrary to their elevated concentration in plasma. Rodent models of PD disease have shown a positive effect of SCFAs on behavior and PD symptoms. Butyrate, as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, exerts neuroprotective activity, reducing dopaminergic cell death, and motor impairment, and improving cognitive functions. Taken together, SCFAs play an important role in protection from PD disease and could be proposed as representative gut-oriented indicators for diversifying individuals with PD and placing disease progression.",worsen

Preclinical tests on genetically modified mice with @Disease$ demonstrated the correlation between Akkermansia muciniphila and Bilophila wadsworthia abundance and decreased the mice motor activity. Furthermore, @Species$ produces high amounts of pro-inflammatory hydrogen sulphide, correlated with PD pathology and being a neurotoxin affecting brain mitochondrial energy homeostasis through the inhibition of brain glutathione concentration. The second bacterial species, Bilophila wadsworthia, is considered to be the main producer of sulphite in the human gut microbiome, leading to intestinal inflammatory states and the reduction of blood glutathione levels.",None
"Clinical studies have shown different results regarding the concentration of SCFAs in blood, intestine, and feces in patients with obesity.

Oppositely, other studies suggested that patients with obesity had higher levels of @Chemical$ in their @Cellline$ and feces than healthy participants. They showed that higher fecal SCFAs levels with less efficient SCFAs absorption into blood were associated with obesity and cardiometabolic dysregulation.

"In summary, the gut microbiota generates a series of bioactive metabolites to interact with host metabolism. These metabolites mainly include SCFAs, primary and secondary BAs, TMAO, and so on. Among these metabolites, some exert synergistic effects to promote host health by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system to control glucose metabolism. For example, SCFAs interact with human hormones such as GLP-1 and PYY to effect energy uptake and the development of obesity. @Chemical$ are beneficial for regulating appetite and energy intake, and preventing the formation of atherosclerosis. Other metabolites, such as TMAO and phenylacetylglutamine (PAGln), may be toxic. For example, TMAO may be proatherogenic to promote the process of thrombosis and atherosclerosis, thereby increasing the risk of cardiovascular events. Patients with CVDs had lower levels of SCFA generation and higher levels of TMAO production due to the change in gut microbiota. Furthermore, TMAO causes vascular endothelial damage and promotes the production of atherosclerotic plaques. TMAO can also increase the release of intracellular calcium ions, enhance the reactivity of platelets, and increase the risk of @Disease$ to increase CVDs susceptibility. Besides, PAGln enhances platelet reactivity and thrombosis, leading to CVDs. Taken together, mounting evidence suggests that changes in gut microbiota metabolites are part of the crucial mechanisms by which the gut microbiota regulates the occurrence and development of CVDs.",None

In patients with CVDs and corresponding risk factors, the composition and ratio of gut microbiota have significant differences compared with their healthy counterparts. Therefore, gut microbiota dysbiosis, gut microbiota-generated metabolites, and the related signaling pathway may serve as explanations for some of the mechanisms about the occurrence and development of CVDs.

"The mechanism by which BCAAs induce insulin resistance is still not fully understood. The rise of BCAA levels is found to regulate glycolipid metabolism, cause insulin resistance, and increase the risk of T2D. Other animal experiments have shown that elevated BCAAs are transferred to skeletal muscle, and are interfered with lipid metabolism, which causes the accumulation of lipid metabolites and ultimately leads to skeletal muscle insulin resistance. Additionally, BCAAs are the key regulatory factor of mTORC1.

"TMAO has been mechanistically linked to atherosclerosis and is also proposed as a promotor and predictor of clinical vascular events in CAD. Plasma TMAO levels are associated with long-term risks of cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndrome, at least in particular related to its pro-inflammatory capacity, promoting the adhesion ability of aortic endothelial cells. In mechanism, TMAO enhances platelet hyperreactivity by altering Ca2+ signaling and elicits a pro-thrombotic effect. Especially, TMAO seems to induce systemic inflammation that contributes to CAD progression. This is particularly relevant given that TMAO directly activates inflammatory pathways, and elicits perturbations in @Cellline$ dynamics in human @Cellline$ and smooth muscle cells.

A positive correlation between polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (N-3 PUFA), and alpha-linolenic acid (aLNA) ingestion and protection against PD development in dose-response trends was demonstrated. American studies demonstrated that PUFA replacement with increased animal fat intake (Western Diet) significantly increased the risk of PD in males only. Excessive animal fat intake can promote dysbiosis and the production of harmful microbial metabolites, which can increase the prevalence of the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, sex differences are implicated in the mental health and prevalence of psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, and neurodegenerative disorders. It has been demonstrated that PD patients usually have altered microbiome compositions compared with controls. Similar to AD, many sex differences in PD are correlated with the protective nature of estrogens, as they are impacted by the gut-brain axis and protect against oxidative damage, thereby supporting dopaminergic function. It has been demonstrated that at age 45, the estimated overall lifetime risk for AD is about 20% for females and 10% for males, which is followed by a disruption in the patient's gut microbiota composition.

"The origins of Parkinson's disease are the result of many factors such as increased age, polygenic factors (disease-segregating mutations in alpha-synuclein protein occurring in 15% of PD patients), toxins, and infectious agents.

One of the key pathological hallmarks of PD is Lewy bodies, being eosinophilic inclusion forms of misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates. Importantly, alpha-synuclein protein has a tendency to misfold and form aggregates. Its accumulation has been detected during bacterial and viral infections in the gut. Moreover, it can be recognized as a characteristic indicator of PD neural degeneration. This protein aggregate can boost the local immune response. Interestingly, alpha-synuclein deposition has been confirmed in the neurons of the intestinal submucosa, together with a possibility of the alpha-synuclein transport to the brain via the vagus nerve (translocation of prion-like proteins).

"At the end of this chapter, it is worth mentioning the fact that the interaction between the microbiome and the host is bidirectional, and some metabolic changes, which could be a pathological result of disease progression, also influence microbiome metabolism. A good example is a disturbance in cholesterol homeostasis, which correlates with an augmented probability of Alzheimer's disease occurrence. In addition, alteration of the intestinal microbiota composition with the subsequent fluctuations in the serum and brain levels of bile acids (BAs) is involved in the development of AD. BAs can act as detergents, affecting BBB permeability, and incrementing brain influx of peripheral cholesterol and BAs. Therefore, proper cholesterol elimination pathways play a crucial role in AD prevention and treatment. The gut microbiome is a main ""organ"" metabolizing secondary bile acids. Peripheral cholesterol is eliminated mainly through its @Cellline$ conversion to @Chemical$. The gut microbiota performs BA transformation via deconjugation and dehydroxylation, leading to secondary BA formation.

Interestingly, the analysis indicated an imbalanced BA ratio, underlying an increased amount of secondary BAs over primary ones. Another clinical study confirmed the correlation between bile acid metabolic profile and the prevalence of AD and mild cognitive impairment, showing similar BA ratio disruptions. Decreased cognitive functions were positively associated with increased concentrations of secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid, and glycolithocholic acid.

"In summary, the gut microbiota generates a series of bioactive metabolites to interact with host metabolism. These metabolites mainly include SCFAs, primary and secondary BAs, TMAO, and so on. Among these metabolites, some exert synergistic effects to promote host health by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system to control glucose metabolism. For example, SCFAs interact with human hormones such as GLP-1 and PYY to effect energy uptake and the development of obesity. SCFAs are beneficial for regulating appetite and energy intake, and preventing the formation of atherosclerosis. Other metabolites, such as TMAO and phenylacetylglutamine (PAGln), may be toxic. For example, TMAO may be proatherogenic to promote the process of thrombosis and atherosclerosis, thereby increasing the risk of cardiovascular events. Patients with @Disease$ had lower levels of @Chemical$ generation and higher levels of TMAO production due to the change in gut microbiota.

"Experimental research confirms the hypothesis regarding SCFA reduction in autoimmune diseases (MS among others) and altered gut microbiota. A low level of SCFAs dysregulates Treg cell functions, leading to insufficient immune tolerance towards endogenous components and enteric microbiota. However, this process can be reversed by SCFAs supplementation (e.g., propionic acid). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity. Moreover, @Chemical$ (TUDCA) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing NFkappaB activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute @Disease$ and on microglial cells in vitro. TUDCA binds to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) expressed in microglial cells. This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS). Experimental results demonstrated that TUDCA acted as a double-edged sword, triggering microglia enhancement in anti-inflammatory and alternatively activated markers and on the other hand reducing the infiltration of macrophages and microglia with expressed pro-inflammatory markers. Interestingly, during neuroinflammation, microglial cells change their morphology, converting themselves into reactive macrophage-like forms. However, microglial cells are flexible, as they can sometimes polarize towards alternatively activated phenotypes, promoting CNS pathologies (proinflammatory or M1 microglia), or exert anti-inflammatory effects, boosting cell repair and remodeling. Bile acids were identified as nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor agonists, leading to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) depletion (in a mouse model) and neuroinflammatory process adjustment. The administration of the complex probiotic positively influenced the intestinal flora balance in patients diagnosed with MS.

However, this process can be reversed by SCFAs supplementation (e.g., propionic acid). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing NFkappaB activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation and on microglial cells in vitro. TUDCA binds to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) expressed in microglial cells. This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS). Experimental results demonstrated that TUDCA acted as a double-edged sword, triggering microglia enhancement in anti-inflammatory and alternatively activated markers and on the other hand reducing the infiltration of macrophages and microglia with expressed pro-inflammatory markers. Interestingly, during neuroinflammation, microglial cells change their morphology, converting themselves into reactive macrophage-like forms. However, microglial cells are flexible, as they can sometimes polarize towards alternatively activated phenotypes, promoting CNS pathologies (proinflammatory or M1 microglia), or exert anti-inflammatory effects, boosting cell repair and remodeling. Bile acids were identified as nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor agonists, leading to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) depletion (in a mouse model) and neuroinflammatory process adjustment. The administration of the complex probiotic positively influenced the intestinal flora balance in patients diagnosed with MS. The @Species$ prevented the onset of dysbiosis, significantly increasing the amount of Methanobrevibacter and @Species$, Prevotella, and Sutterella in MS patients, influencing gene expression and the production of beneficial bacterial metabolites.",increase
"The interplay between the microbiome, @Chemical$, and neuropathological processes present during neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and PD. The microbiome and microbial metabolites could regulate brain homeostasis via four different ways: 1. direct absorption of specific metabolites which have the ability to cross the BBB; 2. interaction between peripheral immune systems, which interact with brain glia cells and astrocytes; 3. influence on gut hormones and the enteroendocrine system; 4. communication via the vagus nerve. These four routes may have an influence on pathological symptoms such as increased BBB leakage and neural inflammation, enhanced beta-amyloid and alpha-synuclein formation, and finally @Disease$ and motor/cognitive deficits.",increase
"The most significant characteristic of gut microbiota in hypertensive patients is the decrease in microbial diversity, richness and the uneven distribution. Researchers conducted 16S amplicon sequencing on fecal samples from patients with hypertension, and used Bayesian network analysis to find the relationship between blood pressure and the abundance of gut microbiota. The results showed that changes in blood pressure could affect bacterial abundance. Moreover, Nathalia Santos Magalhaes et al. reviewed the changes in gut microbiota in @Disease$ @Species$, in which Klebsiella, Desulfovibrio and Prevotella increased, while Blautia, Butyrivibrio, Clostridium, Enterococcus, Faecalibacterium, Oscillibacter, Roseburia, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus decreased.",experiences
"The origins of Parkinson's disease are the result of many factors such as increased age, polygenic factors (disease-segregating mutations in alpha-synuclein protein occurring in 15% of PD patients), @Chemical$, and infectious agents. In 2006, Braak et al. assumed the gut-related origins of Parkinson's disease. One of the key pathological hallmarks of PD is Lewy bodies, being eosinophilic inclusion forms of misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates. Importantly, alpha-synuclein protein has a tendency to misfold and form aggregates. Its accumulation has been detected during bacterial and viral infections in the gut. Moreover, it can be recognized as a characteristic indicator of PD neural degeneration. This protein aggregate can boost the local immune response. Interestingly, alpha-synuclein deposition has been confirmed in the neurons of the intestinal submucosa, together with a possibility of the alpha-synuclein transport to the brain via the vagus nerve (translocation of prion-like proteins). Misfolded alpha-synuclein triggers @Disease$ and progressive degeneration, thereby enabling disease progression. Additionally, alpha-synuclein deposition in CNS is associated with intestinal hyperpermeability, TLRs, and pro-inflammatory cytokine overexpression. Animal models showed that alpha-synuclein aggregation in PD is associated with disorders of lipid metabolism, especially concerning phospholipids and sphingolipids.",None
