"However host-microbiota interplay is not exclusively restricted to cell-cell interactions. Intestinal microbes are capable of producing a plethora of different types of compounds, i.e., small molecules (amino acids, neurotransmitters, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and other fatty acid derivatives, indoles, vitamins, and cofactors), polysaccharides, and proteins (i.e., bacteriocins), which have been reported as important factors in shaping the bacterial community and modulation of the immune system. It has been demonstrated that intestinal bacterial strains such as @Species$ or Lactobacillus spp. interact directly with the host's CNS (central nervous system), as they can release neurotransmitters such as @Chemical$, noradrenaline, histamine, acetylcholine, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), or serotonin. This metabolic status of the microbiome is also vulnerable to dysbiosis and compositional changes and often leads to metabolic disturbances. For example, dysbiosis can induce elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, intensifying oxidative stress and neuronal inflammatory processes. It has been estimated that 40% of the metabolites detected in humans are the products of bacterial metabolism, which plays a fundamental role in the modulation of the host's physiological processes, including immune-mediated neurodegeneration or affecting neural cell metabolism.",start
"The gut microbial community is the largest micro-ecosystem in the human body, formed by more than 1000 different species, with high density per mL and encoding approximately 4 x 106 genes, 150 times more unique than the human genome. It is predicted that the total weight of our gut microbiota deposit circulates around 1-2 kg, approximately reaching the human brain weight. Ninety-five percent of symbiotic microorganisms are located in the gut. These multi-species ecological arrangements mostly comprise anaerobic bacteria, with at least 500-1000 different species and more than 7000 strains, mainly from the Firmicutes and @Species$ (accounting for approx. 90% of bacterial species). In addition, the gut microbiome is co-inhabited by bacteria belonging to Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia phyla, as well as archaea, viruses, fungi, bacteriophages, and protozoa (especially during pathologic conditions), which reside in the @Cellline$, maintaining symbiosis with the host.",Location_of
"Previous results have indicated that the metabolic regulation of BAs may be associated with T2D but the specific changes in BAs and the related mechanisms remain to be studied. It is also unclear how the different types of BAs change in patients with T2D. A study also suggested that patients with T2D had no change in plasma total BAs, but had an increase in DCA and a decrease in CDCA in plasma. Another study found that the plasma total BA concentration in patients with T2D was not significantly different from that of healthy people; however, the concentration of DCA in the plasma of patients with T2D was significantly higher than that of healthy controls. The mechanism may be that FXR and TGR5 are inhibited during insulin resistance, and the most effective natural ligands of the receptors, DCA and CA, are compensatorily increased. Besides, circulating BAs levels including DCA, TCA, TDCA, and glycodeoxycholic acid, are positively associated with the risk of T2D, while taurohyodeoxycholic acid is negatively associated with diabetes. This may be due to the fact that @Chemical$ (such as DCA) have been shown to be involved in @Disease$ and endoplasmic reticulum stress with glucose dysregulation, and hydrophilic BAs isoforms (such as tauroursodeoxycholic acid) have been shown to prevent inflammation and enhance insulin sensitivity.",affects
"The most significant characteristic of gut microbiota in hypertensive patients is the decrease in microbial diversity, richness and the uneven distribution. Researchers conducted 16S amplicon sequencing on fecal samples from patients with hypertension, and used Bayesian network analysis to find the relationship between blood pressure and the abundance of gut microbiota. The results showed that changes in blood pressure could affect bacterial abundance. Moreover, Nathalia Santos Magalhaes et al. reviewed the changes in gut microbiota in @Disease$ patients, in which Klebsiella, Desulfovibrio and @Species$ increased, while Blautia, Butyrivibrio, Clostridium, Enterococcus, Faecalibacterium, Oscillibacter, Roseburia, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus decreased.",increase

"BAs are steroid carboxylic acids mainly derived from @Chemical$ through the action of CYP7A1, and their main function is to digest and absorb lipids and fat-soluble vitamins in the small intestine. The gut microbiota can also affect health by modulating the metabolic levels of total BAs, DCA and LCA, either by metabolizing bile salts or modulating downstream signaling pathways of BAs. Most gut microbiota have BSH activity. For example, Firmicutes have @Species$, which most intestinal microorganisms do not have.

"Recent evidence has demonstrated the importance of the gut microbiota in the formation and development of the immune system. The gut microbiota has profound effects on the formation of lymphoid tissue and the development of the immune system. It stimulates the development of intestinal-associated lymphoid tissues, activates lymphocytes, and regulates the production of immunoglobulin A to defend against pathogens. The structural components of gut microbiota such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), flagella, and peptidoglycan, can interact with receptors on human cells to stimulate and guide the host immune response. For instance, LPS binds to Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, flagella binds to TLR5, and peptidoglycan binds to TLR2, triggering the expression of a large number of downstream inflammatory factors, thereby affecting the cardiovascular system. Specially, @Chemical$ can interact with different receptors to induce @Disease$ and immune responses to increase intestinal permeability and CVDs susceptibility (Fig. 1).",causes
"It is currently controversial whether supplementation with BCAAs would increase circulating BCAAs, thereby increasing the risk of diabetes. And reducing BCAAs intake promotes fat mass loss and insulin sensitivity in mice with obesity. A high BCAAs diet causes excessive feeding, mainly due to excessive appetite. Adding threonine to balance the composition of amino acids in the diet can inhibit food intake. Nevertheless, some studies have found that supplementary BCAAs, such as isoleucine and leucine, can improve insulin resistance and reduce weight to lower the risk of obesity and diabetes. The inconsistency may be due to the individual state of energy excess or energy deficiency. In terms of an excessive energy state, such as in patients with obesity or diabetes who have an impaired ability to degrade BCAAs, BCAAs and related metabolites accumulate in circulation to reduce insulin sensitivity and cause insulin resistance. In most elderly people with inadequate energy or athletes who maintain good fitness habits, BCAAs can improve the form of metabolism. In these people, BCAAs decomposition metabolism is increased by regulatory factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha coactivator (PGC-1alpha) and PPARalpha, so that BCAAs levels are maintained in a steady state, which ultimately promotes glucose intake and insulin sensitivity. This was supported by the study of Newgard, who pointed out that dietary intake of BCAAs might interact with a high-fat diet to induce abnormal metabolic phenotypes such as insulin resistance. @Species$ fed BCAAs alone did not develop insulin resistance. However, when @Species$ were fed a high-fat diet supplemented with BCAAs, they developed insulin resistance. This study suggested that BCAAs only lead to insulin resistance in the presence of excess energy intake. Therefore, more studies are needed to explore the supplementation with BCAAs and insulin resistance as well as the development of cardiovascular risk factors.",None
"In the past decade, single dietary factors which can positively manipulate the gut microbiota-brain axis through microbiome modulation have gained significant attention. One of these factors is probiotic bacteria and/or prebiotics. Probiotics are defined as microbial organisms with a beneficial role in the host's health and homeostasis, which help to preserve digestive, metabolic, immune, and neuroendocrine functions. Naturally probiotic bacteria can be found in fermented food. Experimental results revealed that the administration of probiotics alone or in combination with prebiotics (fructooligosaccharides or galactooligosaccharides) improved the gastrointestinal barrier, which is the first line of ""defence"" from harmful factors occurring in food, and the microbiome. Probiotics and prebiotics are well-documented ""problem-solution"" for gastrointestinal diseases. Moreover, probiotics can reduce CNS inflammatory processes and activation of microglia, demonstrating promising potential for use in neurodegenerative diseases as ingestible ""psychobiotics"". Many studies indicate that the ingestion of probiotics can serve as a microbiological strategy against neurodegenerative diseases such as AD; however, the exact mechanism is under investigation. Experiments performed on mice underline the hypothesis that mechanisms related to neuroprotective effects of Bifidobacterium breve administration may be connected with neuroinflammation and cognition pathways, probably through the production of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) neurotransmitter and the regulation of the gut microbial composition. Clinical results of a randomized double-blind controlled trial revealed that 3-month exposure to Lactobacillus spp. And a Bifidobacterium bifidum ""cocktail"" enhanced cognitive functions and memory, as examined in a mini-mental state test. It was demonstrated that Bifidobacterium breve exerts positive and unique activity in AD patients, improving cognitive functions and reducing neuroinflammation.

"Moreover, Nod-like receptors (NLRs) are also important pattern recognition receptors that are very important for the maintenance of the intestinal microecology and mucosal barrier.

LPS released by gut microbiota can further promote the expression of NLRP3.

"Scientific evidence indicates that the metabolic status of microbiota exerts a more important role than the equilibrium between bacterial species. Microbial metabolites can act as positive modulators of the gut-brain-axis constituents, boosting the immune cells and exerting a positive/protective effect on neurodegenerative disease progression. On the other hand, disrupted equilibrium between microbial species often leads to specific switches in the microbial metabolome, which may be harmful and associated with neurodegenerative disease progression. For example, dysregulation of Gram-negative bacteria in the gastrointestinal area leads to the production of harmful metabolites (i.e., endo- and exotoxins, saccharides, and amyloids). Exotoxins, such as LPS, which have the ability to activate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, exert negative effects. LPS belongs to glycolipid molecules, mostly produced by Gram-negative bacterial strains. These molecules participate in the integrity maintenance of the bacterial outer-membrane permeability barrier, playing an important role in host-pathogen interplay. The overproduction of bacterial @Chemical$ can cause the activation of the @Cellline$, therefore stimulating the production of cytokines with pro-inflammatory activity, such as IL-18 or IL-1beta. LPS can be translocated and intensify neuroinflammatory diseases such as AD. Additionally, it was demonstrated that IL-1beta can decrease the phagocytic function of microglial cells, stimulating the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, and causing reduced synaptic plasticity and cognitive deterioration. These cytokines can induce microbiota dysregulation, increasing gut permeability and influencing gut bacteria diversity.",causes
@Disease$ in @Species$ and Adolescents with Neuropsychiatric Disorders: A Systematic Review,None
"The function of the gut microbiota is closely related to the risk of CVDs. Specifically, an impaired mucosal barrier, overactivated inflammation, and immune dysfunction are crucial steps in the development of CVDs triggered by gut microbiota dysbiosis. The structural constituents of gram-negative bacteria, such as LPS, are the main reason for endotoxemia and impaired intestinal mucosal barrier function. It has been reported that @Chemical$ is important in the development of cardiometabolic diseases. Moreover, studies showed that the high-fat diet could result in decreased intestinal levels of gram-positive Bifidobacteria and increased LPS-containing gut microbiota which further leads to obesity, the main risk factor for CVDs. Importantly, continuous subcutaneous infusion of LPS showed a tendency to cause the change of glucose metabolism and the pattern of weight gain was similar to that seen when taking a high-fat diet. Therefore, intestinal dysbiosis and the corresponding change in metabolites lead to abnormal nutrient metabolism, insulin resistance, and increased adipose tissue storage, which increases the risk of cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity and @Disease$. Herein, we take obesity and diabetes as examples to explain the effect of gut microbiota on cardiovascular risk factors (Fig. 3).",None
"Importantly, studies found that the occurrence of CVDs was also involved in the immune response mediated by the NLR family. For example, atherosclerotic plaques in LDLR-/- NOD 1/2-/- mice showed less lipid deposition and macrophage aggregation, suggesting that lack of NOD 1/2 may reduce the occurrence of atherosclerosis. Moreover, the peptidoglycan components in bacteria can bind to NOD1 and NOD2, which in turn mediate the occurrence of the inflammatory response, and further leads to atherosclerosis. Besides, inflammation induced by the NLRP3 inflammasome plays a role in the interaction between gut microbiota and cardiometabolic diseases. For instance, the @Disease$ mice had altered composition of the gut microbiota, decreased @Chemical$ and LPS levels, as well as downregulated hepatic steatosis and myocardial energy metabolism. Nevertheless, another study reported that NOD TLR4 -/- mice developed higher body weight, hyperlipidemia, severe insulin, and glucose intolerance, lower circulating SCFAs levels, higher levels of Bacteroidetes, lower levels of Firmicutes in the large intestine, as well as fewer SCFAs-associated gut microbiota, all of which may promote the development of insulin-deficient diabetes.",decrease
"Recent studies underlined the important role of the gut microbiota in bidirectional crosstalk in Huntington's disease (HD).

Ultimately, the gut dysbiosis state was also described in a transgenic mice model representing Huntington's disease. Kong et al. found increased Bacteroidetes and decreased Firmicutes levels in a R6/1 transgenic mice model. In this study, dysbiosis was followed by body weight deterioration, gastrointestinal motility problems, and the loss of motor ability. Subsequent studies performed by the same group revealed the negative correlation between Blautia producta and butyrate production. Moreover, Prevotella scopos was negatively associated with ATP levels. Clinical trials performed on patients suffering from Huntington's disease revealed the prevalence of bacterial phyla belonging to Firmicutes (83%), Actinobacteria (9%), Bacteroidetes (4%), and Verrucomicrobia (1.1%) detected in the collected fecal samples. The results of performed human randomized clinical trials positively correlate with the data obtained in mouse models in which gut microbiota dysbiosis was observed.

"Recently, bacterial strains producing SCFAs have gained extreme popularity. SCFAs are small organic monocarboxylic acids, released after the fermentation of indigestible alimentary fiber (mainly galacto- or fructooligosaccharides), plant-derived polysaccharides, or the metabolism of amino acids, and are considered a key gut-derived metabolites with beneficial health effects and as essential in gut-brain crosstalk. The type of formed SCFAs is correlated with the kind of fiber ingested and the overall gut microbiota population. For example, microbes belonging to @Species$ (e.g., Lachnospiraceae, Eubacterium, or Roseburia belonging to the @Species$ class) are responsible for the main production of butyrate, whereas Bifidobacteria spp. produce lactate and acetate. SCFAs are significantly reduced during dysbiosis, where disrupted gut epithelial integrity, inflammation, and altered microbiome metabolic processes occur. In a healthy colon, levels of SCFAs can vary depending on a diet; however, in multiple diseases, these levels are altered. SCFAs may also act in an indirect or direct way through G-protein-coupled receptors or as histone deacetylase epigenetic modulators. They participate in various physiological processes, such as cell energetics and colonocyte metabolism and skeletal, adipose, and liver tissue modulation.

It has been reported that LPS is important in the development of cardiometabolic diseases. Moreover, studies showed that the high-fat diet could result in decreased intestinal levels of gram-positive Bifidobacteria and increased LPS-containing gut microbiota which further leads to obesity, the main risk factor for CVDs. Importantly, continuous subcutaneous infusion of LPS showed a tendency to cause the change of glucose metabolism and the pattern of weight gain was similar to that seen when taking a high-fat diet. Therefore, intestinal dysbiosis and the corresponding change in metabolites lead to abnormal nutrient metabolism, insulin resistance, and increased adipose tissue storage, which increases the risk of cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity and diabetes. Herein, we take obesity and diabetes as examples to explain the effect of gut microbiota on cardiovascular risk factors (Fig. 3).",causes
"It is currently controversial whether supplementation with BCAAs would increase circulating BCAAs, thereby increasing the risk of diabetes. And reducing @Chemical$ intake promotes fat mass loss and @Gene$ sensitivity in mice with obesity. A high BCAAs diet causes excessive feeding, mainly due to excessive appetite. Adding threonine to balance the composition of amino acids in the diet can inhibit food intake. Nevertheless, some studies have found that supplementary BCAAs, such as isoleucine and leucine, can improve insulin resistance and reduce weight to lower the risk of obesity and diabetes. The inconsistency may be due to the individual state of energy excess or energy deficiency. In terms of an excessive energy state, such as in patients with obesity or diabetes who have an impaired ability to degrade BCAAs, BCAAs and related metabolites accumulate in circulation to reduce insulin sensitivity and cause insulin resistance. In most elderly people with inadequate energy or athletes who maintain good fitness habits, BCAAs can improve the form of metabolism. In these people, BCAAs decomposition metabolism is increased by regulatory factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha coactivator (PGC-1alpha) and PPARalpha, so that BCAAs levels are maintained in a steady state, which ultimately promotes glucose intake and insulin sensitivity. This was supported by the study of Newgard, who pointed out that dietary intake of BCAAs might interact with a high-fat diet to induce abnormal metabolic phenotypes such as insulin resistance. Mice fed BCAAs alone did not develop insulin resistance. However, when mice were fed a high-fat diet supplemented with BCAAs, they developed insulin resistance. This study suggested that BCAAs only lead to insulin resistance in the presence of excess energy intake. Therefore, more studies are needed to explore the supplementation with BCAAs and insulin resistance as well as the development of cardiovascular risk factors.",Interacts_with

Huntington's disease has genetic origins related to trinucleotide expansion (CAG) in the huntingtin coding gene. Moreover, experiments performed in mice models revealed that the altered microbiota observed in the HD-suffering individuals at the pre-motor symptomatic stage highly influence health status. HD microbiota composition indicated dysbiosis, disturbances in cytokine levels, and an increase in sulphur metabolism characterized by hydrogen sulphide overproduction and negatively influencing gut health. Ultimately, the gut dysbiosis state was also described in a transgenic mice model representing Huntington's disease. Kong et al. found increased Bacteroidetes and decreased Firmicutes levels in a R6/1 transgenic mice model. In this study, dysbiosis was followed by body weight deterioration, gastrointestinal motility problems, and the loss of motor ability.

"Aromatic amino acids including tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine are metabolized into indole and phenols by certain intestinal anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, and Peptostreptococcus. Tryptophan is decomposed into indole, indoleacetic acid, indole-3-lactic acid, 3-methylindole (skatole) and other indole compounds under the action of tryptophanase. Tryptophanase is the key enzyme that generates indole. The activity of the enzyme is easily induced by the substrate tryptophan, so when the amount of tryptophan changes in the colonic environment, the content of indole will fluctuate greatly. Of note, the metabolic products of aromatic amino acids generated by gut microbiota have a great impact on the pathology of @Disease$. For example, indole propionic acid is associated with insulin sensitivity and appears to reduce the risk of diabetes. Moreover, the gut microbiota metabolizes dietary tryptophan to indoxyl, which further generates indoxyl sulfate through sulfonation.

"At the end of this chapter, it is worth mentioning the fact that the interaction between the microbiome and the host is bidirectional, and some metabolic changes, which could be a pathological result of disease progression, also influence microbiome metabolism. A good example is a disturbance in cholesterol homeostasis, which correlates with an augmented probability of Alzheimer's disease occurrence. In addition, alteration of the intestinal microbiota composition with the subsequent fluctuations in the serum and brain levels of bile acids (BAs) is involved in the development of AD. BAs can act as detergents, affecting BBB permeability, and incrementing brain influx of peripheral cholesterol and BAs. Therefore, proper cholesterol elimination pathways play a crucial role in AD prevention and treatment. The gut microbiome is a main ""organ"" metabolizing secondary bile acids. Peripheral cholesterol is eliminated mainly through its liver conversion to BAs. The @Species$ performs @Chemical$ transformation via deconjugation and dehydroxylation, leading to secondary BA formation.

Interestingly, the analysis indicated an imbalanced BA ratio, underlying an increased amount of secondary BAs over primary ones.

Decreased cognitive functions were positively associated with increased concentrations of secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid, and glycolithocholic acid.

"Experimental research confirms the hypothesis regarding SCFA reduction in autoimmune diseases (MS among others) and altered gut microbiota. A low level of @Chemical$ dysregulates Treg cell functions, leading to insufficient immune tolerance towards endogenous components and enteric microbiota. However, this process can be reversed by SCFAs supplementation (e.g., propionic acid). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing NFkappaB activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation and on microglial cells in vitro. TUDCA binds to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) expressed in microglial cells. This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory @Species$ and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS). Experimental results demonstrated that TUDCA acted as a double-edged sword, triggering microglia enhancement in anti-inflammatory and alternatively activated markers and on the other hand reducing the infiltration of macrophages and microglia with expressed pro-inflammatory markers. Interestingly, during neuroinflammation, microglial cells change their morphology, converting themselves into reactive macrophage-like forms. However, microglial cells are flexible, as they can sometimes polarize towards alternatively activated phenotypes, promoting CNS pathologies (proinflammatory or M1 microglia), or exert anti-inflammatory effects, boosting cell repair and remodeling.

"It remains unclear how the gut microbiota and @Chemical$ profiles interact with each other and whether the interaction is associated with obesity. Mice fed BAs exhibited obesity and a composition change in the obesity-associated gut microbiota, which is similar to high-fat diet-fed mice. Under a high-fat diet, the concentration of intestinal BAs increases, and the composition of gut microbiota alternates. For example, the increased BAs are the main reason for the marked increase in the abundance of the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. Another study has shown that BAs and a high-fat diet promote the growth of Bilophila wadsworthia in mice, and secondary BAs produced by Bilophila spp. have been shown to induce obesity. What's more, it has been reported that the low capacity of microbiota to metabolize Tauro-beta-muricholic acid, a primary BA, might increase the risk of obesity and insulin resistance. Therefore, BAs profiles affect the composition of gut microbiota, and gut microbiota also regulates the production and ratio of different BAs to play an important role in @Disease$ susceptibility.",None
"However host-microbiota interplay is not exclusively restricted to cell-cell interactions. Intestinal microbes are capable of producing a plethora of different types of compounds, i.e., small molecules (amino acids, neurotransmitters, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and other fatty acid derivatives, indoles, vitamins, and cofactors), @Chemical$, and proteins (i.e., bacteriocins), which have been reported as important factors in shaping the bacterial community and modulation of the immune system. It has been demonstrated that intestinal bacterial strains such as Escherichia coli or Lactobacillus spp. interact directly with the host's CNS (central nervous system), as they can release neurotransmitters such as dopamine, noradrenaline, histamine, @Chemical$, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), or serotonin. This metabolic status of the microbiome is also vulnerable to dysbiosis and compositional changes and often leads to metabolic disturbances. For example, dysbiosis can induce elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, intensifying oxidative stress and neuronal inflammatory processes. It has been estimated that 40% of the metabolites detected in humans are the products of bacterial metabolism, which plays a fundamental role in the modulation of the host's physiological processes, including immune-mediated neurodegeneration or affecting neural cell metabolism.",None

"The changes in microbiota and the increased abundance of facultative pathogens are already present in patients with new-onset diabetes, suggesting that microbiome instability is associated with cardiovascular risk factors. Bacteroidetes are detected in children genetically predisposed to type 1 diabetes (T1D).

For example, patients with T2D have reduced Clostridium butyricum in the gut, a main butyrate-producing bacteria. Lower concentrations of butyrate producing microbiota have been observed in fecal samples of patients with T2D. Moreover, Lactobacillus is positively correlated with fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels, while Clostridium is negatively correlated with fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels. Patients with T2D have significantly higher levels of Lactobacillus in fecal samples than healthy individuals.

"BAs, as by-products of cholesterol metabolism, are the main organic component of bile and are synthesized in hepatocytes. Cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) are primary BAs directly synthesized from cholesterol; secondary BAs include deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholic acid (LCA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and their glycine and taurine conjugated forms. BAs are excreted into the intestine to aid in the digestion and absorption of lipids and combine with farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and takeda-G-protein receptor 5 (TGR5) (Fig. 2). There is a strong biochemical relationship between BAs and gut microbiota. Some gut microbiota in healthy people can convert conjugated BAs into free BAs, and can transform BAs into secondary BAs with the help of bile salt hydrolase (BSH) and cholesterol 7-alpha hydroxy-lase (CYP7A1), so as to reduce blood cholesterol by affecting the enterohepatic circulation of BAs. Besides, the @Species$ affects the metabolism of BAs by regulating the activity of @Chemical$ to reduce LDL cholesterol levels. BAs have bacteriostatic properties and an antimicrobial effect. BAs destroy the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane and thereby change the intestinal microecology. BAs also prevent bacteria from overgrowth and decrease inflammation. More importantly, BAs are also closely associated with CVDs. For example, BAs levels in the feces of patients with CVDs are different from those in healthy individuals. And BAs have been reported to regulate vascular tension and affect ion exchange on cardiomyocyte membranes, suggesting that regulating BAs by gut microbiota might be a treatment for CVDs.",improve
"Experimental research confirms the hypothesis regarding SCFA reduction in autoimmune diseases (MS among others) and altered gut microbiota. A low level of SCFAs dysregulates Treg cell functions, leading to insufficient immune tolerance towards endogenous components and enteric microbiota. However, this process can be reversed by SCFAs supplementation (e.g., propionic acid). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (@Chemical$) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing @Gene$ activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation and on microglial cells in vitro. TUDCA binds to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) expressed in microglial cells. This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS). Experimental results demonstrated that TUDCA acted as a double-edged sword, triggering microglia enhancement in anti-inflammatory and alternatively activated markers and on the other hand reducing the infiltration of macrophages and microglia with expressed pro-inflammatory markers. Interestingly, during neuroinflammation, microglial cells change their morphology, converting themselves into reactive macrophage-like forms. However, microglial cells are flexible, as they can sometimes polarize towards alternatively activated phenotypes, promoting CNS pathologies (proinflammatory or M1 microglia), or exert anti-inflammatory effects, boosting cell repair and remodeling. Bile acids were identified as nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor agonists, leading to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) depletion (in a mouse model) and neuroinflammatory process adjustment. The administration of the complex probiotic positively influenced the intestinal flora balance in patients diagnosed with MS. The probiotic prevented the onset of dysbiosis, significantly increasing the amount of Methanobrevibacter and Akkermansia, Prevotella, and Sutterella in MS patients, influencing gene expression and the production of beneficial bacterial metabolites.",decrease
"Insufficient dietary fiber intake is considered to be an important risk factor for diabetes. The decrease in the production of SCFAs counts for an important reason here. Modulation of dietary SCFAs is thought to reshape the gut microbiota in diabetes and ameliorate diabetes. @Chemical$ increase fatty acid oxidation and energy expenditure to decrease the risk of suffering from @Disease$. Of note, T2D patients have lower levels of butyrate-generating bacteria. Butyrate could promote the secretion of postprandial insulin; and the increase in fecal propionic acid was associated with an increase in T2D risk. In oral glucose tolerance test, a high butyrate-producing microbiota was associated with an improved insulin response (indicating improved beta-cell function), and butyrate concentration was directly related to postprandial insulin sensitivity. Besides, in signal transduction regulation, butyrate could also inhibit HDAC expression in juvenile diabetic rats to modulate the p38/ERK/MAPK signaling pathway, which ultimately prevents beta-cell apoptosis and improves glucose homeostasis.",decrease

"Previous results have indicated that the metabolic regulation of BAs may be associated with T2D but the specific changes in BAs and the related mechanisms remain to be studied.

Another study found that the plasma total BA concentration in patients with T2D was not significantly different from that of healthy people; however, the concentration of DCA in the plasma of patients with T2D was significantly higher than that of healthy controls. The mechanism may be that FXR and TGR5 are inhibited during insulin resistance, and the most effective natural ligands of the receptors, DCA and CA, are compensatorily increased. Besides, circulating BAs levels including DCA, TCA, TDCA, and glycodeoxycholic acid, are positively associated with the risk of T2D, while taurohyodeoxycholic acid is negatively associated with diabetes. This may be due to the fact that hydrophobic BAs isoforms (such as DCA) have been shown to be involved in inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress with glucose dysregulation, and hydrophilic BAs isoforms (such as tauroursodeoxycholic acid) have been shown to prevent inflammation and enhance insulin sensitivity.",Location_of

Moreover, sex differences are implicated in the mental health and prevalence of psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, and neurodegenerative disorders. It has been demonstrated that PD patients usually have altered microbiome compositions compared with controls. Similar to AD, many sex differences in PD are correlated with the protective nature of estrogens, as they are impacted by the gut-brain axis and protect against oxidative damage, thereby supporting dopaminergic function.

"Besides the propagation of an inflammatory state, microbial endotoxins are probably involved in AD's inflammatory amyloidosis. Metagenomics analysis showed that patients suffering from cognitive dysfunctions related to amyloidosis demonstrated elevated amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neurotoxic compounds. In these patients, increased inflammation was probably related to Eubacterium deficiency, and an overabundance of gram-negative Escherichia and Shigella species, which are known amyloid producers. They manufacture ""curli"" amyloid fibers, accumulated extracellularly through an elaborated system. Further studies revealed that the overproduction of Abeta plaques is correlated with excessive growth of Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycobacterium and Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus spp.. Galloway et al. found Abeta in small intestine epithelial cells, suggesting that gut-derived amyloids could be absorbed and finally reach systemic circulation, where they can act as pro-inflammatory factors and trigger fibrillogenesis. Additionally, it was shown that @Chemical$ generated by microbes can influence @Species$ and IL-22 proinflammatory cytokines production, considered as a key players in NFkappaB signaling, both associated with AD and capable of crossing the BBB and GI tract.",Interacts_with
"The mechanism by which BCAAs induce insulin resistance is still not fully understood. The rise of BCAA levels is found to regulate glycolipid metabolism, cause insulin resistance, and increase the risk of T2D. Other animal experiments have shown that elevated @Chemical$ are transferred to skeletal muscle, and are interfered with lipid metabolism, which causes the accumulation of lipid metabolites and ultimately leads to skeletal muscle @Disease$. Additionally, BCAAs are the key regulatory factor of mTORC1. It activates mTORC1 and ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (S6K1) by inducing the phosphorylation of IRS1, blocking the insulin signaling pathway, and eventually causing insulin resistance. However, 2 other studies have shown that BCAAs may exert their functions without mTORC1. One study reported that the metabolites of BCAAs, 3-hydroxy isobutyrate, could cause insulin resistance by promoting skeletal muscle sprouting. Another study reported that a diet rich in BCAAs can cause overeating, obesity, and shortened lifespan, which was not related to the mTOR signaling pathway in the liver but is mainly due to hyperphagia.",causes
"Recent studies underlined the important role of the gut microbiota in bidirectional crosstalk in Huntington's disease (HD). Huntington's disease has genetic origins related to trinucleotide expansion (CAG) in the huntingtin coding gene. Moreover, experiments performed in mice models revealed that the altered microbiota observed in the HD-suffering individuals at the pre-motor symptomatic stage highly influence health status. HD microbiota composition indicated dysbiosis, disturbances in cytokine levels, and an increase in sulphur metabolism characterized by hydrogen sulphide overproduction and negatively influencing gut health. Ultimately, the gut dysbiosis state was also described in a transgenic mice model representing Huntington's disease. Kong et al. found increased Bacteroidetes and decreased Firmicutes levels in a R6/1 transgenic mice model. In this study, @Disease$ was followed by body @Disease$, gastrointestinal motility problems, and the loss of motor ability. Subsequent studies performed by the same group revealed the negative correlation between Blautia producta and butyrate production. Moreover, Prevotella scopos was negatively associated with ATP levels. Clinical trials performed on patients suffering from Huntington's disease revealed the prevalence of bacterial phyla belonging to Firmicutes (83%), Actinobacteria (9%), Bacteroidetes (4%), and Verrucomicrobia (1.1%) detected in the collected fecal samples. The results of performed human randomized clinical trials positively correlate with the data obtained in mouse models in which gut microbiota dysbiosis was observed. A Huntington's mouse model revealed endocrine hormonal abnormalities, improper intestinal morphology (decreased mucosal thickness, and villus length), and damaged neuropeptide production.",presence
"BAs, as by-products of cholesterol metabolism, are the main organic component of bile and are synthesized in hepatocytes. Cholic acid (CA) and @Chemical$ (CDCA) are @Chemical$ directly synthesized from cholesterol; secondary BAs include deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholic acid (LCA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and their glycine and taurine conjugated forms. BAs are excreted into the intestine to aid in the digestion and absorption of lipids and combine with farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and takeda-G-protein receptor 5 (TGR5) (Fig. 2). There is a strong biochemical relationship between BAs and gut microbiota. Some gut microbiota in healthy people can convert conjugated BAs into free BAs, and can transform BAs into secondary BAs with the help of bile salt hydrolase (BSH) and cholesterol 7-alpha hydroxy-lase (CYP7A1), so as to reduce blood cholesterol by affecting the enterohepatic circulation of BAs. Besides, the gut microbiota affects the metabolism of BAs by regulating the activity of BSH to reduce LDL cholesterol levels. BAs have bacteriostatic properties and an antimicrobial effect. BAs destroy the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane and thereby change the intestinal microecology. BAs also prevent bacteria from overgrowth and decrease inflammation. More importantly, BAs are also closely associated with CVDs. For example, BAs levels in the feces of patients with CVDs are different from those in healthy individuals.

A study also suggested that patients with T2D had no change in plasma total BAs, but had an increase in DCA and a decrease in CDCA in plasma. Another study found that the plasma total BA concentration in patients with T2D was not significantly different from that of healthy people; however, the concentration of DCA in the plasma of patients with T2D was significantly higher than that of healthy controls. The mechanism may be that FXR and TGR5 are inhibited during insulin resistance, and the most effective natural ligands of the receptors, DCA and CA, are compensatorily increased. Besides, circulating BAs levels including DCA, TCA, TDCA, and glycodeoxycholic acid, are positively associated with the risk of T2D, while taurohyodeoxycholic acid is negatively associated with diabetes. This may be due to the fact that hydrophobic BAs isoforms (such as DCA) have been shown to be involved in inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress with glucose dysregulation, and hydrophilic BAs isoforms (such as tauroursodeoxycholic acid) have been shown to prevent inflammation and enhance insulin sensitivity.",experiences

For example, patients with T2D have reduced Clostridium butyricum in the gut, a main butyrate-producing bacteria. Lower concentrations of butyrate producing microbiota have been observed in fecal samples of patients with T2D. Moreover, Lactobacillus is positively correlated with fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels, while Clostridium is negatively correlated with fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels. Patients with T2D have significantly higher levels of Lactobacillus in fecal samples than healthy individuals.

"Overall, gut microbiota and their implication in the gut-brain axis can be recognized as a crucial factor in neurodegenerative and neurological disorders. Moreover, human studies indicated the correlation between gut dysbiosis and major neurological and psychiatric disorders. The experimental results showed the importance of designing a novel microbiota-based probiotic dietary supplementation with the aim to prevent or ease the symptoms of AD, PD, or other forms of dementia. Promisingly, neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative problems can be ameliorated through targeting the microbiota by microbiota transplantation, antibiotic treatment, or the administration of properly selected probiotics.

"The main end product of bacterial fermentation, and therefore the most predominant, is the SCFA propionic acid (PA), which positively influences CNS regeneration processes such as remyelination (due to the former increase of the amount of intestinal T regulatory cells and protecting against the white matter and axonal loss). Hoyles et al. demonstrated the contribution of propionate to the BBB integrity and the modulation of gut-brain axis. BBB homeostasis and integrity are necessary for proper CNS development and function. Recently, a positive correlation between microbial-induced BBB dysfunction (barrier integrity disturbances followed by leakage) and disorders such as AD has been established. Another member of the SCFAs family, which has a documented influence on homeostasis and @Disease$ progression, is @Chemical$, an important driver of metabolic processes with the ability to influence intestinal macrophages, increasing immunomodulation and decreasing the histone deacetylase inhibition-mediated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Butyrate, as an SCFA, influences the immune response crossing the BBB and drives the maturation and metabolism of microglia cells. It regulates the secretion of gut hormones, such as glucagon-like peptide-1, which can improve hippocampus neuroplasticity. Additionally, in vitro tests conducted by Ho et al. revealed that bacterial SCFAs, such as valeric and butyric acid, exhibited a strong inhibitory effect on amyloid-beta aggregation, which can be absorbed in the intestines and have a negative influence on disease progression.",affects

They are harmless under physical conditions, and have a potential pathogenic influence on the host following changes in the environment.

"In fact, changes in the function of gut microecology and gut microbiota may cause the occurrence and exacerbation of various diseases. It was found that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota may lead to decreased cardiac function and increased cardiomyopathy as well as cardiac insufficiency, which is of great significance in predicting CVDs and also has important predictive significance for the prognosis of adverse cardiovascular events. The gut microbiota has been reported to be associated with CVDs and its corresponding risk factors, such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, and insulin resistance. These risk factors may affect the composition and the diversity of gut microbiota. In addition, gut dysbiosis is also linked to inflammation, oxidative stress, platelet activity, thrombosis and atherosclerosis, which contribute to the progression of CVDs. The possible mechanism of gut microbiota dysbiosis related to CVDs includes its role in increasing intestinal permeability and triggering @Disease$ via the LPS/@Species$ as well as NLRP3 pathways, thereby ultimately contributing to the development of CVDs. In short, the inflammation directly triggers by gut microbiota is one of the possible mechanisms of CVDs susceptibility, and material metabolism affected by gut microbiota was proposed to play a role as well.",causes

In patients with @Disease$ and corresponding risk factors, the composition and ratio of gut microbiota have significant differences compared with their healthy counterparts. Therefore, gut microbiota dysbiosis, gut microbiota-generated metabolites, and the related signaling pathway may serve as explanations for some of the mechanisms about the occurrence and development of CVDs. Several studies have also demonstrated that many traditional and latest therapeutic treatments of CVDs are associated with the gut microbiota and its generated metabolites and related signaling pathways. Given that information, we summarized the latest advances in the current research regarding the effect of gut microbiota on health, the main cardiovascular risk factors, and CVDs, highlighted the roles and mechanisms of several metabolites, and introduced corresponding promising treatments for CVDs regarding the gut microbiota.

"Aromatic amino acids including tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine are metabolized into indole and phenols by certain intestinal anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, and Peptostreptococcus. @Chemical$ is decomposed into indole, indoleacetic acid, indole-3-lactic acid, 3-methylindole (skatole) and other indole compounds under the action of tryptophanase. Tryptophanase is the key enzyme that generates indole. The activity of the enzyme is easily induced by the substrate tryptophan, so when the amount of tryptophan changes in the colonic environment, the content of indole will fluctuate greatly. Of note, the metabolic products of aromatic amino acids generated by gut microbiota have a great impact on the pathology of cardiometabolic diseases. For example, indole propionic acid is associated with insulin sensitivity and appears to reduce the risk of diabetes. Moreover, the gut microbiota metabolizes dietary tryptophan to indoxyl, which further generates indoxyl sulfate through sulfonation. Excessive accumulation of indoxyl sulfate causes cardiomyocyte damage and increases thrombus formation. Another phenol compound, @Chemical$, can inhibit the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into mature adipocytes, induce apoptosis and reduce glucose uptake.

"Scientific evidence indicates that the metabolic status of microbiota exerts a more important role than the equilibrium between bacterial species. Microbial metabolites can act as positive modulators of the gut-brain-axis constituents, boosting the immune cells and exerting a positive/protective effect on neurodegenerative disease progression. On the other hand, disrupted equilibrium between microbial species often leads to specific switches in the microbial metabolome, which may be harmful and associated with neurodegenerative disease progression. For example, dysregulation of Gram-negative bacteria in the gastrointestinal area leads to the production of harmful metabolites (i.e., endo- and exotoxins, saccharides, and amyloids). Exotoxins, such as LPS, which have the ability to activate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, exert negative effects. LPS belongs to glycolipid molecules, mostly produced by Gram-negative bacterial strains. These molecules participate in the integrity maintenance of the bacterial outer-membrane permeability barrier, playing an important role in host-pathogen interplay. The overproduction of bacterial LPS can cause the activation of the macrophage-monocyte nod-like receptor P3 inflammasome, therefore stimulating the production of @Cellline$ with pro-inflammatory activity, such as @Gene$ or IL-1beta. LPS can be translocated and intensify neuroinflammatory diseases such as AD.

Meanwhile, butyrate increases the acetylation of H3 histone in the Forkhead box protein P3 (FOXP3) promoter by inhibiting HDAC4, thus promoting Treg differentiation, affecting G1-phase-specific cyclins, and further resulting in the markedly inhibited proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, thereby inhibiting myocardial fibrosis and improving heart function.",None
"Experimental research confirms the hypothesis regarding SCFA reduction in autoimmune diseases (MS among others) and altered gut microbiota. A low level of SCFAs dysregulates Treg cell functions, leading to insufficient immune tolerance towards endogenous components and enteric microbiota. However, this process can be reversed by @Chemical$ supplementation (e.g., @Chemical$). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing NFkappaB activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation and on microglial cells in vitro. TUDCA binds to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) expressed in microglial cells. This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS). Experimental results demonstrated that TUDCA acted as a double-edged sword, triggering microglia enhancement in anti-inflammatory and alternatively activated markers and on the other hand reducing the infiltration of macrophages and microglia with expressed pro-inflammatory markers. Interestingly, during neuroinflammation, microglial cells change their morphology, converting themselves into reactive macrophage-like forms. However, microglial cells are flexible, as they can sometimes polarize towards alternatively activated phenotypes, promoting CNS pathologies (proinflammatory or M1 microglia), or exert anti-inflammatory effects, boosting cell repair and remodeling. Bile acids were identified as nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor agonists, leading to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) depletion (in a mouse model) and neuroinflammatory process adjustment. The administration of the complex probiotic positively influenced the intestinal flora balance in patients diagnosed with MS. The probiotic prevented the onset of dysbiosis, significantly increasing the amount of Methanobrevibacter and Akkermansia, Prevotella, and Sutterella in MS patients, influencing gene expression and the production of beneficial bacterial metabolites.",Physically_related_to

BAs destroy the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane and thereby change the intestinal microecology. BAs also prevent bacteria from overgrowth and decrease inflammation. More importantly, BAs are also closely associated with CVDs. For example, BAs levels in the feces of patients with CVDs are different from those in healthy individuals.

Mice with higher levels of non-12-OH BAs gained weight slowly and had less metabolic disturbance, while the rapidly gaining weight mice had significantly lower levels of non-12-OH BAs such as UDCA.

"The PD microbiome has a diminished variety of bacterial taxonomic groups, especially the ones associated with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects and the increase of phyla, which has toxic effects. Predominantly, the reduction was observed in the Lachnospiraceae family, including Butyrivibrio, Pseudobutyrivibrio, Coprococcus, Blautia and SCFAs-producing Prevotellaceae. The increased amount of Enterobacteriaceae is linked to the severity of postural instability and walking difficulties. Moreover, the PD microbiome is characterised by increased Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium species and decreased amount of Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae. The overgrowth of Akkermansia spp. in PD patients may be strain-specific and can be related to immune-response alterations, decreased mucus thicknesses, and increased constipation. Faecalibacterium family is a crucial player producing SCFAs and anti-inflammatory metabolites, maintaining gut health. Faecalibacterium balance disturbances can lead to impaired gut-barrier function, increasing the risk of infection with enteric pathogens and boosting alpha-synuclein formation. Similarly, the @Species$ family can produce @Chemical$, important for the proper function of the gut epithelium. Decreased Lachnospiraceae quantity might aggravate gut inflammation, stimulate toxin production, and damage the integrity of the gut epithelial barrier. PD patients' intestinal microflora were characterised by a diminished abundance of Lachnospiraceae, which was positively correlated with PD progress, cognitive decline, and impaired motor functions. These microbiome's compositional changes correlate well with some metabolic switches. PD microbiota show reduced SCFAs production, decreased carbohydrate fermentation, and augmented proteolytic fermentation. Chen et al. demonstrated that the SCFA level was relevant to microbiota composition changes and the clinical severity of PD. The levels of SCFAs acetate, butyrate, and propionate in fecal samples of PD patients were significantly reduced, contrary to their elevated concentration in plasma. Rodent models of PD disease have shown a positive effect of SCFAs on behavior and PD symptoms. Butyrate, as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, exerts neuroprotective activity, reducing dopaminergic cell death, and motor impairment, and improving cognitive functions.

"Patients with obesity had increased BCAAs that contribute to the development of @Disease$. In fact, it is controversial about the mechanism of BCAAs-related insulin resistance. Insulin resistance induced by high-fat and supplemental BCAAs feeding was accompanied by chronic phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), and insulin receptor substrate (IRS)1 Ser307. BCAAs inhibit white fat browning and promote obesity-related metabolic disorders. Some studies have suggested that the role of BCAAs is related to mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). And BCAAs are potent mTORC1 agonists, and a lifelong BCAAs-restricted diet downregulates mTORC1 signaling, reduces frailty, and prolongs lifespan in wild-type male @Species$. Nevertheless, another study found that the metabolic effects of a low BCAAs diet did not require inhibiting the expression and activity of hepatic mTORC1.",None
"It is currently controversial whether supplementation with BCAAs would increase circulating BCAAs, thereby increasing the risk of diabetes. And reducing BCAAs intake promotes fat mass loss and insulin sensitivity in mice with obesity. A high BCAAs diet causes excessive feeding, mainly due to excessive appetite. Adding threonine to balance the composition of amino acids in the diet can inhibit food intake. Nevertheless, some studies have found that supplementary BCAAs, such as @Chemical$ and leucine, can improve @Gene$ resistance and reduce weight to lower the risk of obesity and diabetes. The inconsistency may be due to the individual state of energy excess or energy deficiency. In terms of an excessive energy state, such as in patients with obesity or diabetes who have an impaired ability to degrade BCAAs, BCAAs and related metabolites accumulate in circulation to reduce insulin sensitivity and cause insulin resistance. In most elderly people with inadequate energy or athletes who maintain good fitness habits, BCAAs can improve the form of metabolism. In these people, BCAAs decomposition metabolism is increased by regulatory factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha coactivator (PGC-1alpha) and PPARalpha, so that BCAAs levels are maintained in a steady state, which ultimately promotes glucose intake and insulin sensitivity. This was supported by the study of Newgard, who pointed out that dietary intake of BCAAs might interact with a high-fat diet to induce abnormal metabolic phenotypes such as insulin resistance. Mice fed BCAAs alone did not develop insulin resistance. However, when mice were fed a high-fat diet supplemented with BCAAs, they developed insulin resistance. This study suggested that BCAAs only lead to insulin resistance in the presence of excess energy intake. Therefore, more studies are needed to explore the supplementation with BCAAs and insulin resistance as well as the development of cardiovascular risk factors.",Interacts_with

"The function of the gut microbiota is closely related to the risk of CVDs. Specifically, an impaired mucosal barrier, overactivated inflammation, and immune dysfunction are crucial steps in the development of CVDs triggered by gut microbiota dysbiosis. The structural constituents of gram-negative bacteria, such as LPS, are the main reason for endotoxemia and impaired intestinal mucosal barrier function. It has been reported that LPS is important in the development of cardiometabolic diseases. Moreover, studies showed that the high-fat diet could result in decreased intestinal levels of gram-positive Bifidobacteria and increased LPS-containing gut microbiota which further leads to obesity, the main risk factor for CVDs. Importantly, continuous subcutaneous infusion of @Chemical$ showed a tendency to cause the change of @Disease$ and the pattern of weight gain was similar to that seen when taking a high-fat diet. Therefore, intestinal dysbiosis and the corresponding change in metabolites lead to abnormal nutrient metabolism, insulin resistance, and increased adipose tissue storage, which increases the risk of cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity and diabetes.

"Experimental research confirms the hypothesis regarding SCFA reduction in autoimmune diseases (MS among others) and altered gut microbiota. A low level of SCFAs dysregulates Treg cell functions, leading to insufficient immune tolerance towards endogenous components and enteric microbiota. However, this process can be reversed by SCFAs supplementation (e.g., propionic acid). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing NFkappaB activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation and on microglial cells in vitro. TUDCA binds to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (@Species$/TGR5) expressed in @Cellline$. This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS). Experimental results demonstrated that TUDCA acted as a double-edged sword, triggering microglia enhancement in anti-inflammatory and alternatively activated markers and on the other hand reducing the infiltration of macrophages and microglia with expressed pro-inflammatory markers. Interestingly, during neuroinflammation, microglial cells change their morphology, converting themselves into reactive macrophage-like forms. However, microglial cells are flexible, as they can sometimes polarize towards alternatively activated phenotypes, promoting CNS pathologies (proinflammatory or M1 microglia), or exert anti-inflammatory effects, boosting cell repair and remodeling. Bile acids were identified as nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor agonists, leading to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) depletion (in a mouse model) and neuroinflammatory process adjustment. The administration of the complex probiotic positively influenced the intestinal flora balance in patients diagnosed with MS.

"The origins of Parkinson's disease are the result of many factors such as increased age, polygenic factors (disease-segregating mutations in alpha-synuclein protein occurring in 15% of PD patients), toxins, and infectious agents. In 2006, Braak et al. assumed the gut-related origins of Parkinson's disease. One of the key pathological hallmarks of PD is Lewy bodies, being eosinophilic inclusion forms of misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates. Importantly, alpha-synuclein protein has a tendency to misfold and form aggregates. Its accumulation has been detected during bacterial and viral infections in the gut. Moreover, it can be recognized as a characteristic indicator of PD neural degeneration. This protein aggregate can boost the local immune response. Interestingly, alpha-synuclein deposition has been confirmed in the neurons of the intestinal submucosa, together with a possibility of the alpha-synuclein transport to the brain via the vagus nerve (translocation of prion-like proteins). Misfolded @Species$ triggers neuronal dysfunction and progressive @Disease$, thereby enabling disease progression. Additionally, alpha-synuclein deposition in CNS is associated with intestinal hyperpermeability, TLRs, and pro-inflammatory cytokine overexpression. Animal models showed that alpha-synuclein aggregation in PD is associated with disorders of lipid metabolism, especially concerning phospholipids and sphingolipids.",Associated_with
"Experimental research confirms the hypothesis regarding SCFA reduction in autoimmune diseases (MS among others) and altered gut microbiota. A low level of SCFAs dysregulates Treg cell functions, leading to insufficient immune tolerance towards endogenous components and enteric microbiota. However, this process can be reversed by SCFAs supplementation (e.g., propionic acid). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing NFkappaB activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation and on microglial cells in vitro. @Chemical$ binds to the @Species$/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) expressed in microglial cells. This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS). Experimental results demonstrated that TUDCA acted as a double-edged sword, triggering microglia enhancement in anti-inflammatory and alternatively activated markers and on the other hand reducing the infiltration of macrophages and microglia with expressed pro-inflammatory markers. Interestingly, during neuroinflammation, microglial cells change their morphology, converting themselves into reactive macrophage-like forms. However, microglial cells are flexible, as they can sometimes polarize towards alternatively activated phenotypes, promoting CNS pathologies (proinflammatory or M1 microglia), or exert anti-inflammatory effects, boosting cell repair and remodeling. Bile acids were identified as nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor agonists, leading to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) depletion (in a mouse model) and neuroinflammatory process adjustment. The administration of the complex probiotic positively influenced the intestinal flora balance in patients diagnosed with MS. The probiotic prevented the onset of dysbiosis, significantly increasing the amount of Methanobrevibacter and Akkermansia, Prevotella, and Sutterella in MS patients, influencing gene expression and the production of beneficial bacterial metabolites.",Interacts_with

Another study also provided evidence that a high-fat diet caused obesity by increasing the levels of 12-OH BAs. In a rat model, high-fat diet caused increases in the total BAs, DCA and taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA) in plasma and liver tissues, and increases in DCA in intestinal tissues and feces.

"BAs, as by-products of cholesterol metabolism, are the main organic component of bile and are synthesized in hepatocytes. Cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) are primary BAs directly synthesized from cholesterol; secondary BAs include deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholic acid (LCA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and their glycine and taurine conjugated forms. BAs are excreted into the intestine to aid in the digestion and absorption of lipids and combine with farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and takeda-G-protein receptor 5 (TGR5) (Fig. 2). There is a strong biochemical relationship between BAs and gut microbiota. Some gut microbiota in healthy people can convert conjugated BAs into free BAs, and can transform BAs into secondary BAs with the help of bile salt hydrolase (BSH) and cholesterol 7-alpha hydroxy-lase (CYP7A1), so as to reduce blood cholesterol by affecting the enterohepatic circulation of BAs.

"At the end of this chapter, it is worth mentioning the fact that the interaction between the microbiome and the host is bidirectional, and some metabolic changes, which could be a pathological result of disease progression, also influence microbiome metabolism. A good example is a disturbance in cholesterol homeostasis, which correlates with an augmented probability of Alzheimer's disease occurrence. In addition, alteration of the intestinal microbiota composition with the subsequent fluctuations in the serum and brain levels of bile acids (BAs) is involved in the development of AD. BAs can act as detergents, affecting BBB permeability, and incrementing brain influx of peripheral cholesterol and BAs. Therefore, proper cholesterol elimination pathways play a crucial role in AD prevention and treatment. The gut microbiome is a main ""organ"" metabolizing secondary bile acids.

SCFAs are significantly reduced during dysbiosis, where disrupted gut epithelial integrity, inflammation, and altered microbiome metabolic processes occur. In a healthy colon, levels of SCFAs can vary depending on a diet; however, in multiple diseases, these levels are altered. SCFAs may also act in an indirect or direct way through G-protein-coupled receptors or as histone deacetylase epigenetic modulators. They participate in various physiological processes, such as cell energetics and colonocyte metabolism and skeletal, adipose, and liver tissue modulation. Their major functions comprise the activation of trophic factors, energy management, and the manufacturing of regulatory T-cells.

"The PD microbiome has a diminished variety of bacterial taxonomic groups, especially the ones associated with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects and the increase of phyla, which has toxic effects. Predominantly, the reduction was observed in the Lachnospiraceae family, including Butyrivibrio, Pseudobutyrivibrio, Coprococcus, Blautia and SCFAs-producing Prevotellaceae. The increased amount of Enterobacteriaceae is linked to the severity of postural instability and walking difficulties. Moreover, the @Disease$ microbiome is characterised by increased Akkermansia and @Species$ species and decreased amount of Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae. The overgrowth of Akkermansia spp. in PD patients may be strain-specific and can be related to immune-response alterations, decreased mucus thicknesses, and increased constipation. Faecalibacterium family is a crucial player producing SCFAs and anti-inflammatory metabolites, maintaining gut health. Faecalibacterium balance disturbances can lead to impaired gut-barrier function, increasing the risk of infection with enteric pathogens and boosting alpha-synuclein formation. Similarly, the Lachnospiraceae family can produce butyrate, important for the proper function of the gut epithelium. Decreased Lachnospiraceae quantity might aggravate gut inflammation, stimulate toxin production, and damage the integrity of the gut epithelial barrier. PD patients' intestinal microflora were characterised by a diminished abundance of Lachnospiraceae, which was positively correlated with PD progress, cognitive decline, and impaired motor functions. These microbiome's compositional changes correlate well with some metabolic switches. PD microbiota show reduced SCFAs production, decreased carbohydrate fermentation, and augmented proteolytic fermentation. Chen et al. demonstrated that the SCFA level was relevant to microbiota composition changes and the clinical severity of PD. The levels of SCFAs acetate, butyrate, and propionate in fecal samples of PD patients were significantly reduced, contrary to their elevated concentration in plasma. Rodent models of PD disease have shown a positive effect of SCFAs on behavior and PD symptoms. Butyrate, as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, exerts neuroprotective activity, reducing dopaminergic cell death, and motor impairment, and improving cognitive functions.

"Aromatic amino acids including tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine are metabolized into indole and phenols by certain intestinal anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, and Peptostreptococcus. Tryptophan is decomposed into indole, indoleacetic acid, indole-3-lactic acid, 3-methylindole (skatole) and other indole compounds under the action of tryptophanase. Tryptophanase is the key enzyme that generates indole. The activity of the enzyme is easily induced by the substrate tryptophan, so when the amount of tryptophan changes in the colonic environment, the content of indole will fluctuate greatly. Of note, the metabolic products of aromatic amino acids generated by gut microbiota have a great impact on the pathology of cardiometabolic diseases. For example, indole propionic acid is associated with insulin sensitivity and appears to reduce the risk of diabetes. Moreover, the gut microbiota metabolizes dietary tryptophan to indoxyl, which further generates indoxyl sulfate through sulfonation. Excessive accumulation of indoxyl sulfate causes cardiomyocyte damage and increases thrombus formation. Another phenol compound, @Chemical$, can inhibit the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into mature adipocytes, induce apoptosis and reduce @Chemical$ uptake.

It has been reported that LPS is important in the development of cardiometabolic diseases. Moreover, studies showed that the high-fat diet could result in decreased intestinal levels of gram-positive Bifidobacteria and increased LPS-containing gut microbiota which further leads to obesity, the main risk factor for CVDs. Importantly, continuous subcutaneous infusion of LPS showed a tendency to cause the change of glucose metabolism and the pattern of weight gain was similar to that seen when taking a high-fat diet.

For instance, the translocation of @Species$ to the blood and liver through the portal venous system together with its metabolites are able to stimulate the release of inflammatory factors, and promote the occurrence of @Disease$ as well as hepatitis. Moreover, it has been reported that the gut microbiota also plays an important role in CVDs, which has aroused our great interest.",possible

"Mechanically, current studies suggest that SCFAs may exert their functions through acting as energy substrates and maintaining metabolic integration by a variety of different downstream regulatory mechanisms, such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPRs) with GPR41/Recombinant Free Fatty Acid Receptor (FFAR3), GPR43/FFAR2, GPR109A, Olfactory Receptors 78 (Olfr78) in endocrine cells of the gut wall, as well as histone deacetylases (HDACs) (Fig. 2). GPR41 regulates host energy acquisition and promotes the catabolism of glucose and lipids. The decreased SCFAs may cause less activated GPR41 and higher levels of energy uptake. In addition, it has also been reported that the lower production of SCFAs in gut microbiota would increase the host's capability of obtaining energy from the diet. SCFAs from bacterial fermentation promote the secretion of @Gene$ (@Gene$) and peptide YY (PYY) through GPR43 and GPR41 from intestinal L cells. GLP-1 increased pancreatic insulin secretion, and inhibited the production of glucagon. Deletion of GLP-1 abolished the beneficial effects of prebiotics on weight gain, glucose metabolism, and inflammatory pathway activation. Moreover, PYY increases satiety, reduces food intake, inhibits intestinal motility, and increases the intestinal transit rate.",None
"The mechanism by which BCAAs induce insulin resistance is still not fully understood. The rise of BCAA levels is found to regulate glycolipid metabolism, cause insulin resistance, and increase the risk of T2D. Other animal experiments have shown that elevated BCAAs are transferred to skeletal muscle, and are interfered with lipid metabolism, which causes the accumulation of lipid metabolites and ultimately leads to skeletal muscle insulin resistance. Additionally, @Chemical$ are the key regulatory factor of mTORC1. It activates @Species$ and ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (S6K1) by inducing the phosphorylation of IRS1, blocking the insulin signaling pathway, and eventually causing insulin resistance. However, 2 other studies have shown that BCAAs may exert their functions without mTORC1. One study reported that the metabolites of BCAAs, 3-hydroxy isobutyrate, could cause insulin resistance by promoting skeletal muscle sprouting. Another study reported that a diet rich in BCAAs can cause overeating, obesity, and shortened lifespan, which was not related to the mTOR signaling pathway in the liver but is mainly due to hyperphagia.",start

"In the past decade, single dietary factors which can positively manipulate the gut microbiota-brain axis through microbiome modulation have gained significant attention. One of these factors is probiotic bacteria and/or prebiotics. Probiotics are defined as microbial organisms with a beneficial role in the host's health and homeostasis, which help to preserve digestive, metabolic, immune, and neuroendocrine functions. Naturally probiotic bacteria can be found in fermented food. Experimental results revealed that the administration of probiotics alone or in combination with prebiotics (fructooligosaccharides or galactooligosaccharides) improved the gastrointestinal barrier, which is the first line of ""defence"" from harmful factors occurring in food, and the microbiome. Probiotics and prebiotics are well-documented ""problem-solution"" for gastrointestinal diseases. Moreover, @Species$ can reduce CNS inflammatory processes and activation of microglia, demonstrating promising potential for use in @Disease$ as ingestible ""psychobiotics"". Many studies indicate that the ingestion of probiotics can serve as a microbiological strategy against neurodegenerative diseases such as AD; however, the exact mechanism is under investigation. Experiments performed on mice underline the hypothesis that mechanisms related to neuroprotective effects of Bifidobacterium breve administration may be connected with neuroinflammation and cognition pathways, probably through the production of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) neurotransmitter and the regulation of the gut microbial composition. Clinical results of a randomized double-blind controlled trial revealed that 3-month exposure to Lactobacillus spp. And a Bifidobacterium bifidum ""cocktail"" enhanced cognitive functions and memory, as examined in a mini-mental state test. It was demonstrated that Bifidobacterium breve exerts positive and unique activity in AD patients, improving cognitive functions and reducing neuroinflammation.

"Trillions of microorganisms colonize the anaerobic and nutritious environment in the gut to form a healthy intestinal physiological ecosystem. These communities are regarded as ""gut microbiota"", and the sum total of all microorganism genomes in the gut, including their DNA sequences and other genetic information, are together called ""gut microbiomes"". Most intestinal microbial communities in the human intestinal tract are bacteria with complex structures. There are more than 1,000 species of intestinal bacteria, and the number reaches approximately 1014. The ratio of bacterial number to human cell number ranged from 10:1 to 1:1. It also contains 100-fold more genes than our own genome, which is called the second genome of the human body. In terms of the types of intestinal bacteria, the gut microbiota is mainly composed of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, and this composition is relatively stable in healthy individuals but not in patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) or other diseases. Among those gut microbiota, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in the large intestine account for about 90% of the total number of @Species$, and the ratio is a vital health indicator reflecting the condition of health and is also associated with the incidence of @Disease$. In addition, the gut microbiota maintains a symbiotic or antagonistic relationship with its host to form a dynamic and balanced microbial system.",Marker/Mechanism
"SCFAs may prevent obesity by regulating the homeostasis of glucose and lipid metabolism. For instance, acetate decreases appetite and nutrient intake. Propionate activates intestinal gluconeogenesis by a gut-brain neural circuit to promote energy balance. Butyrate provides energy for colon cells, maintains the integrity of intestinal walls, and improves the insulin response, which activates gluconeogenesis to maintain the balance of glucose and energy through the cAMP pathway. And one study indicated that oral butyrate intake prevents obesity and insulin resistance. Furthermore, the role of SCFAs in metabolic hemostasis is related to other factors. Adenosine monophosphate activating protein (AMPK) is a heterotrimeric enzyme that stimulates liver and muscle fatty acid oxidation pathways. SCFAs promote the activity of AMPK and improve its ability to oxidize fatty acids. Last, SCFAs can affect the development of dyslipidemia. @Chemical$ increase the expression of fasting-induced adipose factor (@Gene$), a circulating lipoprotein lipase inhibitor, by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-gamma), thereby decreasing the activity of lipoproteinases and inhibiting lipolysis in adipose tissues.

"At the end of this chapter, it is worth mentioning the fact that the interaction between the microbiome and the host is bidirectional, and some metabolic changes, which could be a pathological result of disease progression, also influence microbiome metabolism. A good example is a disturbance in cholesterol homeostasis, which correlates with an augmented probability of Alzheimer's disease occurrence. In addition, alteration of the intestinal microbiota composition with the subsequent fluctuations in the serum and brain levels of bile acids (BAs) is involved in the development of AD. BAs can act as detergents, affecting BBB permeability, and incrementing brain influx of peripheral cholesterol and BAs. Therefore, proper cholesterol elimination pathways play a crucial role in AD prevention and treatment. The gut microbiome is a main ""organ"" metabolizing secondary bile acids. Peripheral cholesterol is eliminated mainly through its liver conversion to BAs. The gut microbiota performs BA transformation via deconjugation and dehydroxylation, leading to secondary BA formation. Nho et al. investigated the correlation between neurodegeneration and BAs, B-amyloid, and tau protein concentration. The application of targeted metabolomics enabled the determination of the association between intestinal microbiota-derived secondary bile acids and sera BAs. Interestingly, the analysis indicated an imbalanced BA ratio, underlying an increased amount of secondary BAs over primary ones. Another clinical study confirmed the correlation between @Chemical$ metabolic profile and the prevalence of AD and mild @Disease$, showing similar BA ratio disruptions. Decreased cognitive functions were positively associated with increased concentrations of secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid, and glycolithocholic acid. The described results suggested the involvement of the pathological gut microbiota in AD development; however, still it requires more in-depth studies.",Associated_with

It is worth underlining the role of taurine as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Moreover, it is fabricated and secreted by neurons during stress conditions, e.g., mitochondrial dysfunctions, where taurine seems to increase the neuronal survival rate due to calcium influx regulation and the intensified antioxidant gene expression. In summary, taurine demonstrates an important role in proper brain function and development. Additionally, it contributes to the volume regulation of brain cells, and interferes with synaptic amino acid receptors.",affects
"Importantly, studies found that the occurrence of CVDs was also involved in the immune response mediated by the NLR family. For example, atherosclerotic plaques in LDLR-/- NOD 1/2-/- mice showed less lipid deposition and macrophage aggregation, suggesting that lack of NOD 1/2 may reduce the occurrence of atherosclerosis. Moreover, the peptidoglycan components in bacteria can bind to NOD1 and NOD2, which in turn mediate the occurrence of the inflammatory response, and further leads to atherosclerosis. Besides, inflammation induced by the NLRP3 inflammasome plays a role in the interaction between gut microbiota and cardiometabolic diseases. For instance, the @Disease$ @Species$ had altered composition of the gut microbiota, decreased TMAO and LPS levels, as well as downregulated hepatic steatosis and myocardial energy metabolism. Nevertheless, another study reported that NOD TLR4 -/- mice developed higher body weight, hyperlipidemia, severe insulin, and glucose intolerance, lower circulating SCFAs levels, higher levels of Bacteroidetes, lower levels of Firmicutes in the large intestine, as well as fewer SCFAs-associated gut microbiota, all of which may promote the development of insulin-deficient diabetes.",experiences
"Moreover, Nod-like receptors (NLRs) are also important pattern recognition receptors that are very important for the maintenance of the intestinal microecology and mucosal barrier.

And some @Species$ from other genera have been reported to produce @Species$, which may increase the development of insulin resistance. In short, the dysbiosis of gut microbiota would lead to the damaged function of beta-cell and islet chronic inflammatory response by changing the component of SCFAs, BCAAs, and BAs, thereby affecting glucose and fat metabolism, eventually leading to the occurrence of diabetes.",start
"In summary, the gut microbiota generates a series of bioactive metabolites to interact with host metabolism. These metabolites mainly include SCFAs, primary and secondary BAs, TMAO, and so on. Among these metabolites, some exert synergistic effects to promote host health by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system to control glucose metabolism. For example, SCFAs interact with human hormones such as GLP-1 and PYY to effect energy uptake and the development of obesity. SCFAs are beneficial for regulating appetite and energy intake, and preventing the formation of atherosclerosis. Other metabolites, such as TMAO and phenylacetylglutamine (PAGln), may be toxic. For example, TMAO may be proatherogenic to promote the process of thrombosis and atherosclerosis, thereby increasing the risk of cardiovascular events. Patients with CVDs had lower levels of SCFA generation and higher levels of TMAO production due to the change in gut microbiota. Furthermore, TMAO causes vascular endothelial damage and promotes the production of atherosclerotic plaques. @Chemical$ can also increase the release of intracellular calcium ions, enhance the reactivity of platelets, and increase the risk of @Disease$ to increase CVDs susceptibility.

"Particularly, SCFAs also have anti-inflammatory functions. It was reported that the butyrate and propionate can inhibit the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and NF-kappaB signaling pathways.

Meanwhile, @Chemical$ increases the acetylation of H3 histone in the Forkhead box protein P3 (FOXP3) promoter by inhibiting HDAC4, thus promoting Treg differentiation, affecting G1-phase-specific cyclins, and further resulting in the markedly inhibited proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, thereby inhibiting @Disease$ and improving heart function.",decrease

"Several studies have suggested that different BAs profiles are closely related to obesity.

Mice with higher levels of non-12-OH BAs gained weight slowly and had less metabolic disturbance, while the rapidly gaining weight mice had significantly lower levels of non-12-OH BAs such as UDCA. UDCA intake significantly reduced weight gain and metabolic disturbances induced by high-fat diet.

"The PD microbiome has a diminished variety of bacterial taxonomic groups, especially the ones associated with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects and the increase of phyla, which has toxic effects. Predominantly, the reduction was observed in the Lachnospiraceae family, including Butyrivibrio, Pseudobutyrivibrio, Coprococcus, Blautia and SCFAs-producing Prevotellaceae. The increased amount of Enterobacteriaceae is linked to the severity of postural instability and walking difficulties. Moreover, the PD microbiome is characterised by increased Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium species and decreased amount of Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae. The overgrowth of Akkermansia spp. in PD patients may be strain-specific and can be related to immune-response alterations, decreased mucus thicknesses, and increased constipation. Faecalibacterium family is a crucial player producing SCFAs and anti-inflammatory metabolites, maintaining gut health. Faecalibacterium balance disturbances can lead to impaired gut-barrier function, increasing the risk of infection with enteric pathogens and boosting alpha-synuclein formation. Similarly, the Lachnospiraceae family can produce butyrate, important for the proper function of the gut epithelium. Decreased Lachnospiraceae quantity might aggravate gut inflammation, stimulate toxin production, and damage the integrity of the gut epithelial barrier. @Disease$ @Species$' intestinal microflora were characterised by a diminished abundance of Lachnospiraceae, which was positively correlated with PD progress, cognitive decline, and impaired motor functions. These microbiome's compositional changes correlate well with some metabolic switches.

"Insufficient dietary fiber intake is considered to be an important risk factor for diabetes. The decrease in the production of SCFAs counts for an important reason here. Modulation of dietary SCFAs is thought to reshape the gut microbiota in diabetes and ameliorate diabetes. SCFAs increase fatty acid oxidation and energy expenditure to decrease the risk of suffering from T2D. Of note, T2D patients have lower levels of butyrate-generating bacteria. Butyrate could promote the secretion of postprandial insulin; and the increase in fecal propionic acid was associated with an increase in T2D risk. In oral glucose tolerance test, a high @Species$ was associated with an improved insulin response (indicating improved @Cellline$ function), and butyrate concentration was directly related to postprandial insulin sensitivity.

Meanwhile, increasing evidence indicates that the gut microbiota has a strong correlation with the occurrence, progression and treatment of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). In patients with CVDs and corresponding risk factors, the composition and ratio of gut microbiota have significant differences compared with their healthy counterparts. Therefore, gut microbiota dysbiosis, gut microbiota-generated metabolites, and the related signaling pathway may serve as explanations for some of the mechanisms about the occurrence and development of CVDs.

This metabolic status of the microbiome is also vulnerable to dysbiosis and compositional changes and often leads to metabolic disturbances. For example, dysbiosis can induce elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, intensifying oxidative stress and neuronal inflammatory processes.

Besides, the gut microbiota affects the metabolism of BAs by regulating the activity of BSH to reduce LDL cholesterol levels. BAs have bacteriostatic properties and an antimicrobial effect. BAs destroy the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane and thereby change the intestinal microecology. BAs also prevent bacteria from overgrowth and decrease inflammation. More importantly, BAs are also closely associated with CVDs. For example, BAs levels in the feces of patients with CVDs are different from those in healthy individuals.

BAs are excreted into the intestine to aid in the digestion and absorption of lipids and combine with farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and takeda-G-protein receptor 5 (TGR5) (Fig. 2). There is a strong biochemical relationship between BAs and gut microbiota. Some gut microbiota in healthy people can convert conjugated BAs into free BAs, and can transform BAs into secondary BAs with the help of bile salt hydrolase (BSH) and cholesterol 7-alpha hydroxy-lase (CYP7A1), so as to reduce blood cholesterol by affecting the enterohepatic circulation of BAs. Besides, the gut microbiota affects the metabolism of BAs by regulating the activity of BSH to reduce LDL cholesterol levels. BAs have bacteriostatic properties and an antimicrobial effect. BAs destroy the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane and thereby change the intestinal microecology. @Chemical$ also prevent bacteria from @Disease$ and decrease inflammation. More importantly, BAs are also closely associated with CVDs. For example, BAs levels in the feces of patients with CVDs are different from those in healthy individuals. And BAs have been reported to regulate vascular tension and affect ion exchange on cardiomyocyte membranes, suggesting that regulating BAs by gut microbiota might be a treatment for CVDs.",prevents
"Experimental research confirms the hypothesis regarding SCFA reduction in autoimmune diseases (MS among others) and altered gut microbiota. A low level of SCFAs dysregulates Treg cell functions, leading to insufficient immune tolerance towards endogenous components and enteric microbiota. However, this process can be reversed by SCFAs supplementation (e.g., propionic acid). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing NFkappaB activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation and on microglial cells in vitro. TUDCA binds to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) expressed in microglial cells. This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS). Experimental results demonstrated that @Chemical$ acted as a double-edged sword, triggering microglia enhancement in anti-inflammatory and alternatively activated markers and on the other hand reducing the infiltration of macrophages and @Cellline$ with expressed pro-inflammatory markers. Interestingly, during neuroinflammation, microglial cells change their morphology, converting themselves into reactive macrophage-like forms. However, microglial cells are flexible, as they can sometimes polarize towards alternatively activated phenotypes, promoting CNS pathologies (proinflammatory or M1 microglia), or exert anti-inflammatory effects, boosting cell repair and remodeling. Bile acids were identified as nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor agonists, leading to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) depletion (in a mouse model) and neuroinflammatory process adjustment. The administration of the complex probiotic positively influenced the intestinal flora balance in patients diagnosed with MS. The probiotic prevented the onset of dysbiosis, significantly increasing the amount of Methanobrevibacter and Akkermansia, Prevotella, and Sutterella in MS patients, influencing gene expression and the production of beneficial bacterial metabolites.",improve
"Some of the studies performed show a connection between the pathological microbiota and Alzheimer's disease. Screening tests identified the connection between Escherichia and Shigella bacterial species and increased systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine-related processes, reported in patients with Alzheimer's. Increased inflammatory processes and oxidative stress conditions can trigger neurodegeneration observed in people with Alzheimer's disease. The previously mentioned species belong to Gram-negative bacteria, which are capable of producing huge amounts of pro-inflammatory lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), thereby causing intestinal inflammation and gut barrier disruption. Increased gut permeability permits the transport and the systemic and brain accumulation of LPS or other bacterial toxins and the propagation of an inflammatory state. Moreover, this observation has been confirmed in in vivo studies, where the injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharide into the brain imitates inflammatory and pathological features such as @Disease$ and fibrillogenesis observed in @Disease$.",affects

"Herein we gathered updated knowledge regarding the alterations of gut microbiota (dysbiosis) and its correlation with human neurodegenerative and brain-related diseases, e.g., Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. This review underlines the importance of gut-derived metabolites and gut metabolic status as the main players in gut-brain crosstalk and their implications on the severity of neural conditions. Scientific evidence indicates that the administration of @Chemical$ beneficial and protective effects as reduced systemic inflammation, @Disease$, and inhibited neurodegeneration. The experimental results performed on animals, but also human clinical trials, show the importance of designing a novel microbiota-based probiotic dietary supplementation with the aim to prevent or ease the symptoms of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases or other forms of dementia or neurodegeneration.",decrease

"Contrarily, as a positive example, balanced diets (i.e., Mediterranean diet and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) can be mentioned. Diets abundant in natural compounds with anti-inflammatory activity, antioxidants, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and plant-origin nutrients (proteins, polyphenols, vitamins, and fibers), together with reduced caloric intake, such as the Mediterranean diet, are correlated with a lower risk of dementia, decrease age-related cognitive deterioration, and the risk of neurodegeneration occurrence. Moreover, the Mediterranean diet increases the amount of @Cellline$ @Species$ and Lactobacillus and reduces malignant bacteria belonging to Clostridium and Bacteroides, thereby improving memory and cognitive processes in healthy females after menopause and disorder patients. Additionally, following such a diet significantly reduces amyloid aggregation and therefore the frequency of amyloid-related diseases in the aging population. There are scientific reports that he gut dysfunction is related to the inflammation of the CNS, which can especially be observed in Parkinson's disease patients, where dysregulation of the gut-brain axis was observed in 80% of patients.",Location_of
"Moreover, Nod-like receptors (NLRs) are also important pattern recognition receptors that are very important for the maintenance of the intestinal microecology and mucosal barrier. Except for the TLR family, the role of the NLR family in CVDs susceptibility has now received increasing attention. The NLR family contains nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 1 (NOD1), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) as well as NOD, leucine-rich repeat (LRR), and Pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3). LPS released by gut microbiota can further promote the expression of NLRP3. In fact, after binding to its ligand, NLRs can induce the expression of cytokines and @Species$ through the activation of nuclear factor kappa-B (@Gene$) pathway or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, and further induce the immune inflammatory response.",increase

Diabetes are associated with a relative or absolute insufficiency of insulin, or insulin resistance, which results in metabolic disturbance of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. In China, the number of diabetic patients has reached 114 million, accounting for 1/3 of the total number of diabetic patients all around the world. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) accounts for more than 95% of the total diabetes population. Recently, researchers have pointed out that gut microbiota may play an important role in the occurrence and development of T2D. Thus, exploring the relationship between gut microbiota and T2D may provide new ideas for clinical research and treatment.",Associated_with
