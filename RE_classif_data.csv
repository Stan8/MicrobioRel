"Several studies have suggested that different BAs profiles are closely related to obesity. It was reported that 12-hydroxylated (12-OH) BAs such as CA and DCA increase obesity susceptibility, while non-12-OH BAs such as CDCA, UDCA and LCA reduce obesity susceptibility. Mice with higher levels of @Chemical$ gained weight slowly and had less metabolic disturbance, while the rapidly gaining weight mice had significantly lower levels of non-12-OH BAs such as UDCA. UDCA intake significantly reduced weight gain and metabolic disturbances induced by high-fat diet. Another study also provided evidence that a high-fat diet caused obesity by increasing the levels of 12-OH BAs. In a rat model, high-fat diet caused increases in the total BAs, DCA and taurodeoxycholic acid (@Chemical$) in plasma and liver tissues, and increases in DCA in intestinal tissues and feces. Therefore, changing the proportion of 12-OH BAs and non-12-OH BAs may have an impact on the risk of obesity.",None

"It remains unclear how the gut microbiota and BAs profiles interact with each other and whether the interaction is associated with obesity. @Species$ fed BAs exhibited obesity and a composition change in the obesity-associated gut microbiota, which is similar to high-fat diet-fed mice.

"The mechanism by which BCAAs induce insulin resistance is still not fully understood.

"It is currently controversial whether supplementation with BCAAs would increase circulating BCAAs, thereby increasing the risk of diabetes. And reducing BCAAs intake promotes fat mass loss and insulin sensitivity in mice with obesity. A high BCAAs diet causes excessive feeding, mainly due to excessive appetite. Adding threonine to balance the composition of amino acids in the diet can inhibit food intake. Nevertheless, some studies have found that supplementary BCAAs, such as isoleucine and leucine, can improve insulin resistance and reduce weight to lower the risk of obesity and diabetes. The inconsistency may be due to the individual state of energy excess or energy deficiency. In terms of an excessive energy state, such as in patients with obesity or @Disease$ who have an impaired ability to degrade BCAAs, BCAAs and related metabolites accumulate in circulation to reduce insulin sensitivity and cause insulin resistance. In most elderly people with inadequate energy or athletes who maintain good fitness habits, BCAAs can improve the form of metabolism. In these people, BCAAs decomposition metabolism is increased by regulatory factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha coactivator (PGC-1alpha) and @Gene$, so that BCAAs levels are maintained in a steady state, which ultimately promotes glucose intake and insulin sensitivity. This was supported by the study of Newgard, who pointed out that dietary intake of BCAAs might interact with a high-fat diet to induce abnormal metabolic phenotypes such as insulin resistance. Mice fed BCAAs alone did not develop insulin resistance. However, when mice were fed a high-fat diet supplemented with BCAAs, they developed insulin resistance.

"The gut microbiota is critical to human health, such as digesting nutrients, forming the intestinal epithelial barrier, regulating immune function, producing vitamins and hormones, and producing metabolites to interact with the host.

In patients with @Disease$ and corresponding risk factors, the composition and ratio of gut microbiota have significant differences compared with their healthy counterparts.

"Scientific evidence indicates that the metabolic status of microbiota exerts a more important role than the equilibrium between bacterial species. Microbial metabolites can act as positive modulators of the gut-brain-axis constituents, boosting the immune cells and exerting a positive/protective effect on neurodegenerative disease progression.

"Aromatic amino acids including tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine are metabolized into indole and phenols by certain intestinal anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, and Peptostreptococcus. Tryptophan is decomposed into indole, indoleacetic acid, indole-3-lactic acid, 3-methylindole (skatole) and other indole compounds under the action of tryptophanase. Tryptophanase is the key enzyme that generates indole. The activity of the enzyme is easily induced by the substrate tryptophan, so when the amount of tryptophan changes in the colonic environment, the content of indole will fluctuate greatly. Of note, the metabolic products of aromatic amino acids generated by gut microbiota have a great impact on the pathology of @Disease$. For example, indole propionic acid is associated with insulin sensitivity and appears to reduce the risk of diabetes. Moreover, the gut microbiota metabolizes dietary tryptophan to indoxyl, which further generates indoxyl sulfate through sulfonation. Excessive accumulation of indoxyl sulfate causes cardiomyocyte damage and increases thrombus formation. Another @Chemical$ compound, 4-methylphenol, can inhibit the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into mature adipocytes, induce apoptosis and reduce glucose uptake. In addition, benzoic acid is an aromatic carboxylic acid synthesized by colonic microorganisms by metabolizing dietary aromatic compounds. Plasma benzoic acid levels were found to be elevated in the rat model of polygenic diabetes.",None

"Experimental research confirms the hypothesis regarding SCFA reduction in autoimmune diseases (MS among others) and altered gut microbiota. A low level of SCFAs dysregulates Treg cell functions, leading to insufficient immune tolerance towards endogenous components and enteric microbiota. However, this process can be reversed by SCFAs supplementation (e.g., propionic acid). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing NFkappaB activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation and on microglial cells in vitro. TUDCA binds to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) expressed in microglial cells. This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (@Chemical$ Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS). Experimental results demonstrated that TUDCA acted as a double-edged sword, triggering microglia enhancement in anti-inflammatory and alternatively activated markers and on the other hand reducing the infiltration of macrophages and microglia with expressed pro-inflammatory markers.

"In the past decade, single dietary factors which can positively manipulate the gut microbiota-brain axis through microbiome modulation have gained significant attention. One of these factors is probiotic bacteria and/or prebiotics. Probiotics are defined as microbial organisms with a beneficial role in the host's health and homeostasis, which help to preserve digestive, metabolic, immune, and neuroendocrine functions. Naturally probiotic bacteria can be found in fermented food. Experimental results revealed that the administration of probiotics alone or in combination with prebiotics (fructooligosaccharides or galactooligosaccharides) improved the gastrointestinal barrier, which is the first line of ""defence"" from harmful factors occurring in food, and the microbiome. Probiotics and prebiotics are well-documented ""problem-solution"" for gastrointestinal diseases. Moreover, probiotics can reduce CNS inflammatory processes and activation of microglia, demonstrating promising potential for use in neurodegenerative diseases as ingestible ""psychobiotics"". Many studies indicate that the ingestion of probiotics can serve as a microbiological strategy against neurodegenerative diseases such as AD; however, the exact mechanism is under investigation. Experiments performed on mice underline the hypothesis that mechanisms related to neuroprotective effects of Bifidobacterium breve administration may be connected with neuroinflammation and cognition pathways, probably through the production of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) neurotransmitter and the regulation of the gut microbial composition.

"The health of the gut microbiome can vary depending on various factors including diet (e.g., ingestion of saturated/unsaturated dietary fats, vitamins, minerals, dairy products, alcoholic beverages, polyphenols containing food such as cocoa-rich chocolate, tea, or coffee), dietary patterns, geographical area, and diet-related habits (sometimes varying between males and females) and sex (the influence of sex hormones). A positive correlation between @Chemical$ (PUFA), omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (N-3 PUFA), and alpha-linolenic acid (aLNA) ingestion and protection against PD development in dose-response trends was demonstrated. American studies demonstrated that PUFA replacement with increased @Chemical$ intake (Western Diet) significantly increased the risk of PD in males only. Excessive animal fat intake can promote dysbiosis and the production of harmful microbial metabolites, which can increase the prevalence of the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, sex differences are implicated in the mental health and prevalence of psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, and neurodegenerative disorders. It has been demonstrated that PD patients usually have altered microbiome compositions compared with controls. Similar to AD, many sex differences in PD are correlated with the protective nature of estrogens, as they are impacted by the gut-brain axis and protect against oxidative damage, thereby supporting dopaminergic function. It has been demonstrated that at age 45, the estimated overall lifetime risk for AD is about 20% for females and 10% for males, which is followed by a disruption in the patient's gut microbiota composition. In summary, it is worth underlining the correlation between the gut microbiome, immune system and brain, mental health, and behavior.",None

Another study found that the plasma total BA concentration in patients with T2D was not significantly different from that of healthy people; however, the concentration of DCA in the plasma of patients with T2D was significantly higher than that of healthy controls.

"The mechanism by which BCAAs induce insulin resistance is still not fully understood. The rise of BCAA levels is found to regulate glycolipid metabolism, cause insulin resistance, and increase the risk of T2D. Other animal experiments have shown that elevated BCAAs are transferred to skeletal muscle, and are interfered with lipid metabolism, which causes the accumulation of @Chemical$ metabolites and ultimately leads to skeletal muscle insulin resistance. Additionally, BCAAs are the key regulatory factor of mTORC1. It activates mTORC1 and ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (S6K1) by inducing the phosphorylation of IRS1, blocking the insulin signaling pathway, and eventually causing insulin resistance. However, 2 other studies have shown that @Chemical$ may exert their functions without mTORC1. One study reported that the metabolites of BCAAs, 3-hydroxy isobutyrate, could cause insulin resistance by promoting skeletal muscle sprouting. Another study reported that a diet rich in BCAAs can cause overeating, obesity, and shortened lifespan, which was not related to the mTOR signaling pathway in the liver but is mainly due to hyperphagia.",None

Other animal experiments have shown that elevated BCAAs are transferred to skeletal muscle, and are interfered with lipid metabolism, which causes the accumulation of lipid metabolites and ultimately leads to skeletal muscle insulin resistance. Additionally, BCAAs are the key regulatory factor of mTORC1. It activates mTORC1 and ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (S6K1) by inducing the phosphorylation of IRS1, blocking the insulin signaling pathway, and eventually causing insulin resistance. However, 2 other studies have shown that BCAAs may exert their functions without mTORC1. One study reported that the metabolites of BCAAs, 3-hydroxy isobutyrate, could cause insulin resistance by promoting skeletal muscle sprouting. Another study reported that a diet rich in BCAAs can cause overeating, @Disease$, and shortened lifespan, which was not related to the mTOR signaling pathway in the liver but is mainly due to @Disease$.",None

"It is currently controversial whether supplementation with BCAAs would increase circulating BCAAs, thereby increasing the risk of diabetes. And reducing BCAAs intake promotes fat mass loss and insulin sensitivity in mice with obesity. A high BCAAs diet causes excessive feeding, mainly due to excessive appetite. Adding threonine to balance the composition of amino acids in the diet can inhibit food intake. Nevertheless, some studies have found that supplementary BCAAs, such as isoleucine and leucine, can improve insulin resistance and reduce weight to lower the risk of obesity and diabetes. The inconsistency may be due to the individual state of @Disease$. In terms of an excessive energy state, such as in patients with @Disease$ or diabetes who have an impaired ability to degrade BCAAs, BCAAs and related metabolites accumulate in circulation to reduce insulin sensitivity and cause insulin resistance. In most elderly people with inadequate energy or athletes who maintain good fitness habits, BCAAs can improve the form of metabolism. In these people, BCAAs decomposition metabolism is increased by regulatory factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha coactivator (PGC-1alpha) and PPARalpha, so that BCAAs levels are maintained in a steady state, which ultimately promotes glucose intake and insulin sensitivity. This was supported by the study of Newgard, who pointed out that dietary intake of BCAAs might interact with a high-fat diet to induce abnormal metabolic phenotypes such as insulin resistance. Mice fed BCAAs alone did not develop insulin resistance. However, when mice were fed a high-fat diet supplemented with BCAAs, they developed insulin resistance. This study suggested that BCAAs only lead to insulin resistance in the presence of excess energy intake. Therefore, more studies are needed to explore the supplementation with BCAAs and insulin resistance as well as the development of cardiovascular risk factors.",None

"Mechanically, current studies suggest that SCFAs may exert their functions through acting as energy substrates and maintaining metabolic integration by a variety of different downstream regulatory mechanisms, such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPRs) with GPR41/Recombinant Free Fatty Acid Receptor (FFAR3), @Gene$/FFAR2, GPR109A, Olfactory Receptors 78 (Olfr78) in endocrine cells of the gut wall, as well as histone deacetylases (HDACs) (Fig. 2). GPR41 regulates host energy acquisition and promotes the catabolism of glucose and lipids. The decreased SCFAs may cause less activated GPR41 and higher levels of energy uptake. In addition, it has also been reported that the lower production of SCFAs in gut microbiota would increase the host's capability of obtaining energy from the diet. SCFAs from bacterial fermentation promote the secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY) through GPR43 and GPR41 from intestinal L cells. GLP-1 increased @Disease$, and inhibited the production of glucagon. Deletion of GLP-1 abolished the beneficial effects of prebiotics on weight gain, glucose metabolism, and inflammatory pathway activation. Moreover, PYY increases satiety, reduces food intake, inhibits intestinal motility, and increases the intestinal transit rate.",None

"The PD microbiome has a diminished variety of bacterial taxonomic groups, especially the ones associated with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects and the increase of phyla, which has toxic effects. Predominantly, the reduction was observed in the Lachnospiraceae family, including Butyrivibrio, Pseudobutyrivibrio, Coprococcus, Blautia and SCFAs-producing Prevotellaceae. The increased amount of Enterobacteriaceae is linked to the severity of postural instability and walking difficulties. Moreover, the PD microbiome is characterised by increased Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium species and decreased amount of Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae.

Decreased Lachnospiraceae quantity might aggravate gut inflammation, stimulate toxin production, and damage the integrity of the gut epithelial barrier. PD patients' intestinal microflora were characterised by a diminished abundance of Lachnospiraceae, which was positively correlated with PD progress, cognitive decline, and impaired motor functions. These microbiome's compositional changes correlate well with some metabolic switches. PD microbiota show reduced SCFAs production, decreased carbohydrate fermentation, and augmented proteolytic fermentation. Chen et al. demonstrated that the SCFA level was relevant to microbiota composition changes and the clinical severity of PD. The levels of SCFAs acetate, butyrate, and propionate in fecal samples of PD patients were significantly reduced, contrary to their elevated concentration in plasma. Rodent models of PD disease have shown a positive effect of SCFAs on behavior and PD symptoms. Butyrate, as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, exerts neuroprotective activity, reducing dopaminergic cell death, and motor impairment, and improving cognitive functions.

"Insufficient dietary fiber intake is considered to be an important risk factor for diabetes. The decrease in the production of SCFAs counts for an important reason here. Modulation of dietary SCFAs is thought to reshape the gut microbiota in @Disease$ and ameliorate @Disease$. SCFAs increase fatty acid oxidation and energy expenditure to decrease the risk of suffering from T2D. Of note, T2D patients have lower levels of butyrate-generating bacteria. Butyrate could promote the secretion of postprandial insulin; and the increase in fecal propionic acid was associated with an increase in T2D risk. In oral glucose tolerance test, a high butyrate-producing microbiota was associated with an improved insulin response (indicating improved beta-cell function), and butyrate concentration was directly related to postprandial insulin sensitivity. Besides, in signal transduction regulation, butyrate could also inhibit HDAC expression in juvenile diabetic rats to modulate the p38/ERK/MAPK signaling pathway, which ultimately prevents beta-cell apoptosis and improves glucose homeostasis.",None

"In summary, the gut microbiota generates a series of bioactive metabolites to interact with host metabolism. These metabolites mainly include SCFAs, primary and secondary BAs, TMAO, and so on. Among these metabolites, some exert synergistic effects to promote host health by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system to control glucose metabolism. For example, SCFAs interact with human hormones such as GLP-1 and PYY to effect energy uptake and the development of obesity. SCFAs are beneficial for regulating appetite and energy intake, and preventing the formation of atherosclerosis. Other metabolites, such as TMAO and phenylacetylglutamine (PAGln), may be toxic.

"The function of the gut microbiota is closely related to the risk of CVDs. Specifically, an impaired mucosal barrier, overactivated inflammation, and immune dysfunction are crucial steps in the development of CVDs triggered by gut microbiota dysbiosis.

Moreover, studies showed that the high-fat diet could result in decreased intestinal levels of gram-positive Bifidobacteria and increased LPS-containing gut microbiota which further leads to obesity, the main risk factor for CVDs. Importantly, continuous subcutaneous infusion of LPS showed a tendency to cause the change of glucose metabolism and the pattern of weight gain was similar to that seen when taking a high-fat diet.

"The gut microbiota is critical to human health, such as digesting nutrients, forming the intestinal epithelial barrier, regulating immune function, producing vitamins and hormones, and producing metabolites to interact with the host. Meanwhile, increasing evidence indicates that the gut microbiota has a strong correlation with the occurrence, progression and treatment of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). In patients with CVDs and corresponding risk factors, the composition and ratio of gut microbiota have significant differences compared with their healthy counterparts. Therefore, gut microbiota dysbiosis, gut microbiota-generated metabolites, and the related signaling pathway may serve as explanations for some of the mechanisms about the occurrence and development of CVDs. Several studies have also demonstrated that many traditional and latest therapeutic treatments of CVDs are associated with the gut microbiota and its generated metabolites and related signaling pathways.

They are indispensable for maintaining the physiological function of adult tissues and organs by synthesizing a variety of vitamins, participating in food digestion, producing lactic acid, promoting intestinal peristalsis, inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microbiota, and activating the immune system. For example, one of the most important commensal microbes in the human gut is Bifidobacterium, a strictly anaerobic gram-positive bacterium, which assists the human body in the digestion and absorption of nutrients, resists the invasion of harmful bacteria, improves the immune function of the body, secretes molecules to regulate immune function, and participates in the metabolism of substances in the intestine. Besides, another common commensal microbe, A. muciniphila, a gram-positive bacterium, reduces insulin sensitivity and is inversely associated with the development of obesity and diabetes.

"Given that the gut microbiota is essential in human health, changes in the composition and function of the gut microbiota may result in the development of diseases. Due to the influence of host genes, diet, antibiotic use, lifestyle, @Chemical$ as well as other factors, the composition and diversity of @Species$ gradually change with interindividual variation. For example, a high-fat diet leads to an increase in the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. When the composition and proportion of gut microbiota change, inflammation and metabolic abnormalities can be induced, which contribute to the development of different diseases. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota refers to changes in the number, species and composition of gut microbiota. In recent years, gut microbiota dysbiosis has been shown to be critically involved in health and has emerged as a potential pathogenesis for various diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, cancers, and CVDs. Moreover, gut dysbiosis is also a driver of metabolic inflammation and metabolic dysregulation, which serve as a key feature of metabolic diseases. For instance, the translocation of intestinal bacteria to the blood and liver through the portal venous system together with its metabolites are able to stimulate the release of inflammatory factors, and promote the occurrence of non-alcoholic fatty liver as well as hepatitis. Moreover, it has been reported that the gut microbiota also plays an important role in CVDs, which has aroused our great interest.",affects

"Moreover,@Species$ (NLRs) are also important pattern recognition receptors that are very important for the maintenance of the intestinal microecology and @Cellline$. Except for the TLR family, the role of the NLR family in CVDs susceptibility has now received increasing attention.

"Additionally, it has been reported that the intestinal microbiota plays a very crucial role in the neuroendocrine system, which is correlated to the gut-brain axis. As the major neuroendocrine system, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulates various pathophysiological processes in response to inside and outside stressors. It is increasingly recognized that the establishment of intestinal microbiota in early life can impact the development as well as the function of nervous system, especially regulating neuroendocrine function. In neonatal germ-free @Species$, colonization with @Species$, and Bifidobacterium could attenuate the high sensitivity of the HPA axis and establish functional neural circuits. The imbalanced microbiota may fail to execute metabolic functions, brain function and neuromodulators. The regulation of neurohumoral-immune not only promotes the development of neurological diseases, but also promotes the occurrence and development of CVDs via the HPA axis and renin-angiotensin system (RAS). For example, dysregulation of the gut-brain axis was associated with hypertension. Interestingly, the gut microbiota can be called ""an endocrine organ"" that biologically regulates host metabolism, for affecting the host's endocrine system by altering the functional metabolism of important hormones such as leptin, ghrelin and cortisol.

BAs are excreted into the intestine to aid in the digestion and absorption of lipids and combine with farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and takeda-G-protein receptor 5 (TGR5) (Fig. 2).

Besides, the gut microbiota affects the metabolism of BAs by regulating the activity of BSH to reduce LDL cholesterol levels. BAs have bacteriostatic properties and an antimicrobial effect.

"@Chemical$ including @Chemical$, tryptophan, and phenylalanine are metabolized into indole and phenols by certain intestinal anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, and Peptostreptococcus. Tryptophan is decomposed into indole, indoleacetic acid, indole-3-lactic acid, 3-methylindole (skatole) and other indole compounds under the action of tryptophanase. Tryptophanase is the key enzyme that generates indole. The activity of the enzyme is easily induced by the substrate tryptophan, so when the amount of tryptophan changes in the colonic environment, the content of indole will fluctuate greatly. Of note, the metabolic products of aromatic amino acids generated by gut microbiota have a great impact on the pathology of cardiometabolic diseases. For example, indole propionic acid is associated with insulin sensitivity and appears to reduce the risk of diabetes. Moreover, the gut microbiota metabolizes dietary tryptophan to indoxyl, which further generates indoxyl sulfate through sulfonation. Excessive accumulation of indoxyl sulfate causes cardiomyocyte damage and increases thrombus formation. Another phenol compound, 4-methylphenol, can inhibit the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into mature adipocytes, induce apoptosis and reduce glucose uptake.

"In summary, the gut microbiota generates a series of bioactive metabolites to interact with host metabolism. These @Chemical$ mainly include @Chemical$, primary and secondary BAs, TMAO, and so on. Among these metabolites, some exert synergistic effects to promote host health by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system to control glucose metabolism. For example, SCFAs interact with human hormones such as GLP-1 and PYY to effect energy uptake and the development of obesity. SCFAs are beneficial for regulating appetite and energy intake, and preventing the formation of atherosclerosis. Other metabolites, such as TMAO and phenylacetylglutamine (PAGln), may be toxic. For example, TMAO may be proatherogenic to promote the process of thrombosis and atherosclerosis, thereby increasing the risk of cardiovascular events. Patients with CVDs had lower levels of SCFA generation and higher levels of TMAO production due to the change in gut microbiota. Furthermore, TMAO causes vascular endothelial damage and promotes the production of atherosclerotic plaques. TMAO can also increase the release of intracellular calcium ions, enhance the reactivity of platelets, and increase the risk of thrombosis to increase CVDs susceptibility. Besides, PAGln enhances platelet reactivity and thrombosis, leading to CVDs.

For example, TMAO may be proatherogenic to promote the process of thrombosis and atherosclerosis, thereby increasing the risk of cardiovascular events. Patients with CVDs had lower levels of SCFA generation and higher levels of TMAO production due to the change in gut microbiota. Furthermore, TMAO causes vascular endothelial damage and promotes the production of atherosclerotic plaques. TMAO can also increase the release of intracellular calcium ions, enhance the reactivity of platelets, and increase the risk of thrombosis to increase CVDs susceptibility.

Taken together, mounting evidence suggests that changes in gut microbiota metabolites are part of the crucial mechanisms by which the gut microbiota regulates the occurrence and development of CVDs.",increase
"In summary, the gut microbiota generates a series of bioactive metabolites to interact with host metabolism. These metabolites mainly include SCFAs, primary and secondary BAs, TMAO, and so on. Among these metabolites, some exert synergistic effects to promote host health by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system to control glucose metabolism.

"The function of the @Species$ is closely related to the risk of @Disease$. Specifically, an impaired mucosal barrier, overactivated inflammation, and immune dysfunction are crucial steps in the development of CVDs triggered by gut microbiota dysbiosis. The structural constituents of gram-negative bacteria, such as LPS, are the main reason for endotoxemia and impaired intestinal mucosal barrier function. It has been reported that LPS is important in the development of cardiometabolic diseases. Moreover, studies showed that the high-fat diet could result in decreased intestinal levels of gram-positive Bifidobacteria and increased LPS-containing gut microbiota which further leads to obesity, the main risk factor for CVDs. Importantly, continuous subcutaneous infusion of LPS showed a tendency to cause the change of glucose metabolism and the pattern of weight gain was similar to that seen when taking a high-fat diet. Therefore, intestinal dysbiosis and the corresponding change in metabolites lead to abnormal nutrient metabolism, insulin resistance, and increased adipose tissue storage, which increases the risk of cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity and diabetes. Herein, we take obesity and diabetes as examples to explain the effect of gut microbiota on cardiovascular risk factors (Fig. 3).",Associated_with

BCAAs inhibit white fat browning and promote obesity-related metabolic disorders. Some studies have suggested that the role of BCAAs is related to mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). And BCAAs are potent mTORC1 agonists, and a lifelong BCAAs-restricted diet downregulates mTORC1 signaling, reduces frailty, and prolongs lifespan in wild-type male mice.

In oral glucose tolerance test, a high butyrate-producing microbiota was associated with an improved insulin response (indicating improved beta-cell function), and butyrate concentration was directly related to postprandial insulin sensitivity. Besides, in signal transduction regulation, @Chemical$ could also inhibit HDAC expression in juvenile diabetic rats to modulate the p38/ERK/MAPK signaling pathway, which ultimately prevents beta-cell apoptosis and improves @Disease$.",improve

Another study found that the plasma total BA concentration in patients with T2D was not significantly different from that of healthy people; however, the concentration of DCA in the plasma of patients with T2D was significantly higher than that of healthy controls.

"It is currently controversial whether supplementation with BCAAs would increase circulating @Chemical$, thereby increasing the risk of @Disease$. And reducing BCAAs intake promotes fat mass loss and insulin sensitivity in mice with obesity. A high BCAAs diet causes excessive feeding, mainly due to excessive appetite. Adding threonine to balance the composition of amino acids in the diet can inhibit food intake. Nevertheless, some studies have found that supplementary BCAAs, such as isoleucine and leucine, can improve insulin resistance and reduce weight to lower the risk of obesity and diabetes. The inconsistency may be due to the individual state of energy excess or energy deficiency. In terms of an excessive energy state, such as in patients with obesity or diabetes who have an impaired ability to degrade BCAAs, BCAAs and related metabolites accumulate in circulation to reduce insulin sensitivity and cause insulin resistance. In most elderly people with inadequate energy or athletes who maintain good fitness habits, BCAAs can improve the form of metabolism. In these people, BCAAs decomposition metabolism is increased by regulatory factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha coactivator (PGC-1alpha) and PPARalpha, so that BCAAs levels are maintained in a steady state, which ultimately promotes glucose intake and insulin sensitivity. This was supported by the study of Newgard, who pointed out that dietary intake of BCAAs might interact with a high-fat diet to induce abnormal metabolic phenotypes such as insulin resistance.

In terms of an excessive energy state, such as in patients with obesity or @Disease$ who have an impaired ability to degrade BCAAs, @Chemical$ and related metabolites accumulate in circulation to reduce insulin sensitivity and cause insulin resistance. In most elderly people with inadequate energy or athletes who maintain good fitness habits, BCAAs can improve the form of metabolism. In these people, BCAAs decomposition metabolism is increased by regulatory factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha coactivator (PGC-1alpha) and PPARalpha, so that BCAAs levels are maintained in a steady state, which ultimately promotes glucose intake and insulin sensitivity. This was supported by the study of Newgard, who pointed out that dietary intake of BCAAs might interact with a high-fat diet to induce abnormal metabolic phenotypes such as insulin resistance. Mice fed BCAAs alone did not develop insulin resistance. However, when mice were fed a high-fat diet supplemented with BCAAs, they developed insulin resistance. This study suggested that BCAAs only lead to insulin resistance in the presence of excess energy intake. Therefore, more studies are needed to explore the supplementation with BCAAs and insulin resistance as well as the development of cardiovascular risk factors.",decrease

@Chemical$ induces @Disease$ to increase the risk of CAD,causes
@Chemical$ induces inflammation to increase the risk of @Disease$,increase
"@Chemical$ has been mechanistically linked to @Disease$ and is also proposed as a promotor and predictor of clinical vascular events in CAD. Plasma TMAO levels are associated with long-term risks of cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndrome, at least in particular related to its pro-inflammatory capacity, promoting the adhesion ability of aortic endothelial cells. In mechanism, TMAO enhances platelet hyperreactivity by altering Ca2+ signaling and elicits a pro-thrombotic effect. Especially, TMAO seems to induce systemic inflammation that contributes to CAD progression. This is particularly relevant given that TMAO directly activates inflammatory pathways, and elicits perturbations in membrane dynamics in human aortic ECs and smooth muscle cells. In particular, the exosomes secreted by TMAO-stimulated hepatocytes increase the secretion of TNF-alpha and IL-6, and further promote inflammation.",Associated_with

"However host-microbiota interplay is not exclusively restricted to cell-cell interactions. Intestinal microbes are capable of producing a plethora of different types of compounds, i.e., small molecules (amino acids, neurotransmitters, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and other fatty acid derivatives, indoles, vitamins, and cofactors), polysaccharides, and proteins (i.e., bacteriocins), which have been reported as important factors in shaping the bacterial community and modulation of the immune system. It has been demonstrated that intestinal bacterial strains such as Escherichia coli or Lactobacillus spp. interact directly with the host's CNS (central nervous system), as they can release neurotransmitters such as dopamine, noradrenaline, histamine, acetylcholine, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), or serotonin.

It has been demonstrated that intestinal bacterial strains such as Escherichia coli or @Species$ spp. interact directly with the host's CNS (central nervous system), as they can release neurotransmitters such as dopamine, noradrenaline, histamine, @Chemical$, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), or serotonin. This metabolic status of the microbiome is also vulnerable to dysbiosis and compositional changes and often leads to metabolic disturbances. For example, dysbiosis can induce elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, intensifying oxidative stress and neuronal inflammatory processes. It has been estimated that 40% of the metabolites detected in humans are the products of bacterial metabolism, which plays a fundamental role in the modulation of the host's physiological processes, including immune-mediated neurodegeneration or affecting neural cell metabolism.",start

"Scientific evidence indicates that the metabolic status of microbiota exerts a more important role than the equilibrium between bacterial species. @Chemical$ can act as positive modulators of the gut-brain-axis constituents, boosting the @Cellline$ and exerting a positive/protective effect on neurodegenerative disease progression. On the other hand, disrupted equilibrium between microbial species often leads to specific switches in the microbial metabolome, which may be harmful and associated with neurodegenerative disease progression. For example, dysregulation of Gram-negative bacteria in the gastrointestinal area leads to the production of harmful metabolites (i.e., endo- and exotoxins, saccharides, and amyloids). Exotoxins, such as LPS, which have the ability to activate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, exert negative effects.

It is predicted that in 2030 up to 66 million people will suffer from AD. AD is a multifactorial disease characterized by synapse loss, extracellular cerebral accumulation of insoluble peptides belonging to amyloid-beta (Abeta), the aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein inside the cells, neurofibrillary mass formation, neuronal death (in the neocortex and hippocampus), progressive memory deterioration, and cognition decline leading to dementia. AD is associated with more than 700 genetic and environmental risk factors. From the genetic point of view, one of the most important risk factors related to AD development is the incidence of a ""4 allele variant in the apolipoprotein"" (APOE4) gene, which is associated with cholesterol transport in CNS, and also contributes to metabolomic and taxonomic changes in the microbiome.",experiences

In addition, alteration of the intestinal microbiota composition with the subsequent fluctuations in the serum and brain levels of bile acids (BAs) is involved in the development of AD. BAs can act as detergents, affecting BBB permeability, and incrementing brain influx of peripheral cholesterol and BAs. Therefore, proper cholesterol elimination pathways play a crucial role in AD prevention and treatment. The gut microbiome is a main ""organ"" metabolizing secondary bile acids. Peripheral cholesterol is eliminated mainly through its liver conversion to BAs. The gut microbiota performs BA transformation via deconjugation and dehydroxylation, leading to secondary BA formation. Nho et al. investigated the correlation between neurodegeneration and BAs, B-amyloid, and tau protein concentration. The application of targeted metabolomics enabled the determination of the association between intestinal microbiota-derived secondary bile acids and sera BAs. Interestingly, the analysis indicated an imbalanced BA ratio, underlying an increased amount of secondary BAs over primary ones. Another clinical study confirmed the correlation between bile acid metabolic profile and the prevalence of AD and mild cognitive impairment, showing similar BA ratio disruptions.

In addition, alteration of the intestinal microbiota composition with the subsequent fluctuations in the serum and brain levels of bile acids (BAs) is involved in the development of AD. BAs can act as detergents, affecting BBB permeability, and incrementing brain influx of peripheral cholesterol and BAs. Therefore, proper cholesterol elimination pathways play a crucial role in AD prevention and treatment. The gut microbiome is a main ""organ"" metabolizing secondary bile acids. Peripheral cholesterol is eliminated mainly through its liver conversion to BAs. The gut microbiota performs BA transformation via deconjugation and dehydroxylation, leading to secondary BA formation. Nho et al. investigated the correlation between neurodegeneration and BAs, B-amyloid, and tau protein concentration. The application of targeted metabolomics enabled the determination of the association between intestinal microbiota-derived secondary bile acids and sera BAs. Interestingly, the analysis indicated an imbalanced BA ratio, underlying an increased amount of secondary BAs over primary ones. Another clinical study confirmed the correlation between bile acid metabolic profile and the prevalence of AD and mild cognitive impairment, showing similar BA ratio disruptions. @Disease$ were positively associated with increased concentrations of @Chemical$ such as deoxycholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid, and glycolithocholic acid. The described results suggested the involvement of the pathological gut microbiota in AD development; however, still it requires more in-depth studies.",Associated_with

In 2006, Braak et al. assumed the gut-related origins of Parkinson's disease.

Importantly, alpha-synuclein protein has a tendency to misfold and form aggregates. Its accumulation has been detected during bacterial and viral infections in the gut. Moreover, it can be recognized as a characteristic indicator of PD neural degeneration. This protein aggregate can boost the local immune response. Interestingly, alpha-synuclein deposition has been confirmed in the neurons of the intestinal submucosa, together with a possibility of the alpha-synuclein transport to the brain via the vagus nerve (translocation of prion-like proteins).

"The PD microbiome has a diminished variety of bacterial taxonomic groups, especially the ones associated with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects and the increase of phyla, which has toxic effects. Predominantly, the reduction was observed in the Lachnospiraceae family, including Butyrivibrio, Pseudobutyrivibrio, Coprococcus, Blautia and SCFAs-producing Prevotellaceae. The increased amount of @Species$ is linked to the severity of @Disease$. Moreover, the PD microbiome is characterised by increased Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium species and decreased amount of Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae. The overgrowth of Akkermansia spp. in PD patients may be strain-specific and can be related to immune-response alterations, decreased mucus thicknesses, and increased constipation. Faecalibacterium family is a crucial player producing SCFAs and anti-inflammatory metabolites, maintaining gut health. Faecalibacterium balance disturbances can lead to impaired gut-barrier function, increasing the risk of infection with enteric pathogens and boosting alpha-synuclein formation. Similarly, the Lachnospiraceae family can produce butyrate, important for the proper function of the gut epithelium. Decreased Lachnospiraceae quantity might aggravate gut inflammation, stimulate toxin production, and damage the integrity of the gut epithelial barrier. PD patients' intestinal microflora were characterised by a diminished abundance of Lachnospiraceae, which was positively correlated with PD progress, cognitive decline, and impaired motor functions. These microbiome's compositional changes correlate well with some metabolic switches. PD microbiota show reduced SCFAs production, decreased carbohydrate fermentation, and augmented proteolytic fermentation. Chen et al. demonstrated that the SCFA level was relevant to microbiota composition changes and the clinical severity of PD. The levels of SCFAs acetate, butyrate, and propionate in fecal samples of PD patients were significantly reduced, contrary to their elevated concentration in plasma. Rodent models of PD disease have shown a positive effect of SCFAs on behavior and PD symptoms. Butyrate, as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, exerts neuroprotective activity, reducing dopaminergic cell death, and motor impairment, and improving cognitive functions. Taken together, SCFAs play an important role in protection from PD disease and could be proposed as representative gut-oriented indicators for diversifying individuals with PD and placing disease progression.",Associated_with

Faecalibacterium family is a crucial player producing SCFAs and anti-inflammatory metabolites, maintaining gut health. Faecalibacterium balance disturbances can lead to impaired gut-barrier function, increasing the risk of infection with enteric pathogens and boosting alpha-synuclein formation. Similarly, the Lachnospiraceae family can produce butyrate, important for the proper function of the gut epithelium. Decreased Lachnospiraceae quantity might aggravate gut inflammation, stimulate toxin production, and damage the integrity of the gut epithelial barrier. PD patients' intestinal microflora were characterised by a diminished abundance of Lachnospiraceae, which was positively correlated with PD progress, cognitive decline, and impaired motor functions. These microbiome's compositional changes correlate well with some metabolic switches. PD microbiota show reduced SCFAs production, decreased carbohydrate fermentation, and augmented proteolytic fermentation. Chen et al. demonstrated that the SCFA level was relevant to microbiota composition changes and the clinical severity of PD. The levels of SCFAs acetate, butyrate, and propionate in fecal samples of PD patients were significantly reduced, contrary to their elevated concentration in plasma. Rodent models of PD disease have shown a positive effect of SCFAs on behavior and PD symptoms. Butyrate, as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, exerts neuroprotective activity, reducing dopaminergic cell death, and motor impairment, and improving cognitive functions.

"The PD microbiome has a diminished variety of bacterial taxonomic groups, especially the ones associated with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects and the increase of phyla, which has toxic effects. Predominantly, the reduction was observed in the Lachnospiraceae family, including Butyrivibrio, Pseudobutyrivibrio, Coprococcus, Blautia and SCFAs-producing Prevotellaceae.

The overgrowth of Akkermansia spp. in PD patients may be strain-specific and can be related to immune-response alterations, decreased mucus thicknesses, and increased constipation. Faecalibacterium family is a crucial player producing SCFAs and anti-inflammatory metabolites, maintaining gut health. Faecalibacterium balance disturbances can lead to impaired gut-barrier function, increasing the risk of infection with enteric pathogens and boosting alpha-synuclein formation. Similarly, the Lachnospiraceae family can produce butyrate, important for the proper function of the gut epithelium. Decreased Lachnospiraceae quantity might aggravate gut inflammation, stimulate toxin production, and damage the integrity of the gut epithelial barrier. PD patients' intestinal microflora were characterised by a diminished abundance of Lachnospiraceae, which was positively correlated with PD progress, cognitive decline, and impaired motor functions. These microbiome's compositional changes correlate well with some metabolic switches. PD microbiota show reduced SCFAs production, decreased carbohydrate fermentation, and augmented proteolytic fermentation. Chen et al. demonstrated that the SCFA level was relevant to microbiota composition changes and the clinical severity of PD. The levels of SCFAs acetate, butyrate, and propionate in fecal samples of PD patients were significantly reduced, contrary to their elevated concentration in plasma. Rodent models of PD disease have shown a positive effect of SCFAs on behavior and PD symptoms. Butyrate, as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, exerts neuroprotective activity, reducing dopaminergic cell death, and motor impairment, and improving cognitive functions. Taken together, @Chemical$ play an important role in protection from PD disease and could be proposed as representative gut-oriented indicators for diversifying individuals with @Disease$ and placing disease progression.",improve

"Experimental research confirms the hypothesis regarding @Chemical$ reduction in @Disease$ (MS among others) and altered gut microbiota. A low level of SCFAs dysregulates Treg cell functions, leading to insufficient immune tolerance towards endogenous components and enteric microbiota. However, this process can be reversed by SCFAs supplementation (e.g., propionic acid). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing NFkappaB activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation and on microglial cells in vitro. TUDCA binds to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) expressed in microglial cells. This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS). Experimental results demonstrated that TUDCA acted as a double-edged sword, triggering microglia enhancement in anti-inflammatory and alternatively activated markers and on the other hand reducing the infiltration of macrophages and microglia with expressed pro-inflammatory markers. Interestingly, during neuroinflammation, microglial cells change their morphology, converting themselves into reactive macrophage-like forms.

"Experimental research confirms the hypothesis regarding SCFA reduction in @Disease$ (@Disease$ among others) and altered gut microbiota. A low level of SCFAs dysregulates Treg cell functions, leading to insufficient immune tolerance towards endogenous components and enteric microbiota. However, this process can be reversed by SCFAs supplementation (e.g., propionic acid). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing NFkappaB activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation and on microglial cells in vitro. TUDCA binds to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) expressed in microglial cells.

This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS). Experimental results demonstrated that TUDCA acted as a double-edged sword, triggering microglia enhancement in anti-inflammatory and alternatively activated markers and on the other hand reducing the infiltration of macrophages and microglia with expressed pro-inflammatory markers. Interestingly, during neuroinflammation, microglial cells change their morphology, converting themselves into reactive macrophage-like forms. However, microglial cells are flexible, as they can sometimes polarize towards alternatively activated phenotypes, promoting CNS pathologies (proinflammatory or M1 microglia), or exert anti-inflammatory effects, boosting cell repair and remodeling. Bile acids were identified as nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor agonists, leading to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) depletion (in a mouse model) and neuroinflammatory process adjustment. The administration of the complex probiotic positively influenced the intestinal flora balance in patients diagnosed with MS.

"Experimental research confirms the hypothesis regarding SCFA reduction in autoimmune diseases (MS among others) and altered gut microbiota. A low level of SCFAs dysregulates Treg cell functions, leading to insufficient immune tolerance towards endogenous components and enteric microbiota. However, this process can be reversed by SCFAs supplementation (e.g., propionic acid). Furthermore, research results indicated that MS is also connected with intestinal permeability disruption and the altered metabolism of bile acids, causing the dysregulation of the immune and nervous systems. Bile acids can act as CNS inflammatory signalling modulators, e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid can exert microglia inflammatory-inhibiting activity. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) can direct microglia phenotypes towards an anti-inflammatory state, reducing NFkappaB activation and exerting a neuroprotective effect both in the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation and on microglial cells in vitro. TUDCA binds to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) expressed in microglial cells. This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS).

This binding follows an increased level of microglial intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), inducing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-4Ralpha, IL-10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M IRAK-M, programmed cell death ligand 1 PD-L1, and sphingosine kinase 1 Sphk1) and reducing the ones with pro-inflammatory activity (ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS). Experimental results demonstrated that TUDCA acted as a double-edged sword, triggering microglia enhancement in anti-inflammatory and alternatively activated markers and on the other hand reducing the infiltration of macrophages and microglia with expressed pro-inflammatory markers. Interestingly, during neuroinflammation, microglial cells change their morphology, converting themselves into reactive macrophage-like forms. However, microglial cells are flexible, as they can sometimes polarize towards alternatively activated phenotypes, promoting CNS pathologies (proinflammatory or M1 microglia), or exert anti-inflammatory effects, boosting cell repair and remodeling. Bile acids were identified as nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor agonists, leading to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) depletion (in a mouse model) and neuroinflammatory process adjustment.

"Recent studies underlined the important role of the gut microbiota in bidirectional crosstalk in Huntington's disease (HD). Huntington's disease has genetic origins related to trinucleotide expansion (CAG) in the huntingtin coding gene. Moreover, experiments performed in mice models revealed that the altered microbiota observed in the HD-suffering individuals at the pre-motor symptomatic stage highly influence health status. HD microbiota composition indicated dysbiosis, disturbances in cytokine levels, and an increase in sulphur metabolism characterized by hydrogen sulphide overproduction and negatively influencing gut health. Ultimately, the gut dysbiosis state was also described in a transgenic mice model representing Huntington's disease. Kong et al. found increased Bacteroidetes and decreased Firmicutes levels in a R6/1 transgenic mice model. In this study, dysbiosis was followed by body weight deterioration, gastrointestinal motility problems, and the loss of motor ability.

Diets abundant in natural compounds with anti-inflammatory activity, antioxidants, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and plant-origin nutrients (proteins, polyphenols, vitamins, and fibers), together with reduced caloric intake, such as the Mediterranean diet, are correlated with a lower risk of dementia, decrease age-related cognitive deterioration, and the risk of neurodegeneration occurrence. Moreover, the Mediterranean diet increases the amount of gut Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus and reduces malignant bacteria belonging to Clostridium and Bacteroides, thereby improving memory and cognitive processes in healthy females after menopause and disorder patients. Additionally, following such a diet significantly reduces amyloid aggregation and therefore the frequency of amyloid-related diseases in the aging population.

"In the past decade, single dietary factors which can positively manipulate the gut microbiota-brain axis through microbiome modulation have gained significant attention.

A positive correlation between polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (N-3 PUFA), and alpha-linolenic acid (aLNA) ingestion and protection against PD development in dose-response trends was demonstrated. American studies demonstrated that PUFA replacement with increased animal fat intake (Western Diet) significantly increased the risk of PD in males only. Excessive animal fat intake can promote dysbiosis and the production of harmful microbial metabolites, which can increase the prevalence of the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, sex differences are implicated in the mental health and prevalence of psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, and neurodegenerative disorders. It has been demonstrated that PD patients usually have altered microbiome compositions compared with controls. Similar to AD, many sex differences in PD are correlated with the protective nature of estrogens, as they are impacted by the gut-brain axis and protect against oxidative damage, thereby supporting dopaminergic function. It has been demonstrated that at age 45, the estimated overall lifetime risk for AD is about 20% for females and 10% for males, which is followed by a disruption in the patient's gut microbiota composition.
